1. You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.  (Leetcode 70)

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int dp[] = new int[n+1];
        dp[0] = dp[1] = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
}

2. Given a number of stairs and a frog, the frog wants to climb from the 0th stair to the (N-1)th stair. At a time the frog can climb either one or two steps. 
A height[N] array is also given. Whenever the frog jumps from a stair i to stair j, 
the energy consumed in the jump is abs(height[i]- height[j]), where abs() means the absolute difference. We need to return the minimum energy that can be used by the frog to jump from stair 0 to stair N-1.(TUF question)

public static void main(String args[]) {

  int height[]={30,10,60,10,60,50};
  int n=height.length;
  int dp[]=new int[n];
  Arrays.fill(dp,-1);
  dp[0]=0;
  for(int ind=1;ind<n;ind++){
      int jumpTwo = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int jumpOne= dp[ind-1] + Math.abs(height[ind]-height[ind-1]);
        if(ind>1)
            jumpTwo = dp[ind-2] + Math.abs(height[ind]-height[ind-2]);
    
        dp[ind]=Math.min(jumpOne, jumpTwo);
  }
  System.out.println(dp[n-1]);
}

3. In this article, we will learn about "Dynamic Programming: Frog Jump with k Distances (DP 4)"

Problem Statement:  Frog Jump with K Distance/ Learn to write 1D DP
Problem Statement:
This is a follow-up question to “Frog Jump” discussed in the previous article. In the previous question, 
the frog was allowed to jump either one or two steps at a time. In this question, 
the frog is allowed to jump up to ‘K’ steps at a time. If K=4, the frog can jump 1,2,3, or 4 steps at every index.

  static int solveUtil(int n, int[] height, int[] dp, int k) {
        dp[0] = 0;

        // Loop through the array to fill in the dp array
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int mmSteps = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

            // Loop to try all possible jumps from '1' to 'k'
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                if (i - j >= 0) {
                    int jump = dp[i - j] + Math.abs(height[i] - height[i - j]);
                    mmSteps = Math.min(jump, mmSteps);
                }
            }
            dp[i] = mmSteps;
        }
        return dp[n - 1]; // The result is stored in the last element of dp
    }

    // Function to find the minimum cost to reach the end of the array
    static int solve(int n, int[] height, int k) {
        int[] dp = new int[n]; // Initialize a memoization array to store calculated results
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
        return solveUtil(n, height, dp, k);
    }
