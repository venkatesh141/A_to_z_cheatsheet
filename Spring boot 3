Password Encoding Algorithm (Simple Explanation)
A password encoding algorithm is a way to convert a password into a secure format so that it cannot be easily read or hacked. This process is known as hashing or encryption.

ðŸ”¹ Why Encode Passwords?
Storing plain text passwords is risky.
If a hacker gets access to the database, they can see all passwords.
Encoding makes it impossible (or very hard) to get the original password back.
ðŸ”¹ How Does It Work?
User enters a password â†’ Example: "MySecret123"
Algorithm converts it into a coded format â†’ Example output:
"sdf3$@1klj!90d83f" (This is unreadable and cannot be reversed)
This encoded password is stored in the database instead of the original password.
When the user logs in, their entered password is encoded again and compared with the stored encoded password.
If both match, access is granted.
ðŸ”¹ Common Password Encoding Algorithms
BCrypt â†’ Secure and slow (prevents fast hacking attacks)
PBKDF2 â†’ Uses multiple iterations to increase security
Argon2 â†’ Modern and highly secure (recommended)
SHA-256 â†’ Fast but less secure (use with salting for better security)
ðŸ”¹ Example in Java (Spring Security - BCrypt)
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

public class PasswordEncodingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
        String rawPassword = "MySecret123";
        String encodedPassword = encoder.encode(rawPassword);

        System.out.println("Encoded Password: " + encodedPassword);
    }
}
âœ… Each time you run it, the encoded password will be different (because of salting, which adds random data for security).

ðŸ”¹ Key Points
Hashing is one-way â†’ You cannot decode it back to the original password.
Salting adds random data to prevent attacks.
Use strong algorithms like BCrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2 for security.
