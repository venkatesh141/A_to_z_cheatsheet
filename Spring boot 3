Password Encoding Algorithm (Simple Explanation)
A password encoding algorithm is a way to convert a password into a secure format so that it cannot be easily read or hacked. This process is known as hashing or encryption.

🔹 Why Encode Passwords?
Storing plain text passwords is risky.
If a hacker gets access to the database, they can see all passwords.
Encoding makes it impossible (or very hard) to get the original password back.
🔹 How Does It Work?
User enters a password → Example: "MySecret123"
Algorithm converts it into a coded format → Example output:
"sdf3$@1klj!90d83f" (This is unreadable and cannot be reversed)
This encoded password is stored in the database instead of the original password.
When the user logs in, their entered password is encoded again and compared with the stored encoded password.
If both match, access is granted.
🔹 Common Password Encoding Algorithms
BCrypt → Secure and slow (prevents fast hacking attacks)
PBKDF2 → Uses multiple iterations to increase security
Argon2 → Modern and highly secure (recommended)
SHA-256 → Fast but less secure (use with salting for better security)
🔹 Example in Java (Spring Security - BCrypt)
java
Copy
Edit
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

public class PasswordEncodingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BCryptPasswordEncoder encoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
        String rawPassword = "MySecret123";
        String encodedPassword = encoder.encode(rawPassword);

        System.out.println("Encoded Password: " + encodedPassword);
    }
}
✅ Each time you run it, the encoded password will be different (because of salting, which adds random data for security).

🔹 Key Points
Hashing is one-way → You cannot decode it back to the original password.
Salting adds random data to prevent attacks.
Use strong algorithms like BCrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2 for security.

what is multi factor authentication explain me in simple form

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - Simple Explanation
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires more than one way to verify your identity before granting access.

Instead of just entering a password, you need to provide an extra layer of security to confirm it's really you.

Example:
Imagine you are logging into your bank account:
1️⃣ Enter your password (something you know)
2️⃣ Enter an OTP sent to your phone (something you have)

Now, even if a hacker steals your password, they still need your phone to access your account.

Common MFA Factors:
✔ Something You Know → Password, PIN
✔ Something You Have → OTP, Phone, Smart Card
✔ Something You Are → Fingerprint, Face ID

💡 Why Use MFA?
🔒 Increases security
🚫 Prevents unauthorized access
📱 Used in banking, emails, and social media
