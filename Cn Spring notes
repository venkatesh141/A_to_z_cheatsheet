What is Spring?
Spring is a popular framework in Java used to build applications.
It provides tools to make development faster, easier, and more organized.
It helps developers manage things like:
Dependency Injection: It automatically provides the objects your code needs.
Configuration: Simplifies the setup of your project.
Loose Coupling: Makes code flexible and easy to maintain.
Where is Spring used?
Web applications.
Backend APIs.
Enterprise applications.
What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a simplified version of Spring.
It helps developers create Spring applications quickly and easily by:
Reducing boilerplate code (less setup, more coding).
Providing default configurations so you donâ€™t need to configure everything manually.
Embedding a web server (like Tomcat) so your application can run without additional setup.
Key Features of Spring Boot
No XML Configurations: Everything is done using annotations.
Embedded Server: Comes with built-in servers like Tomcat or Jetty, so you can run your app as a standalone Java program.
Auto-Configuration: Automatically sets up many parts of your application based on your code.
Production-Ready: Provides monitoring, metrics, and health-check features out of the box.
Difference Between Spring and Spring Boot
Spring	Spring Boot
Requires a lot of setup.	Minimal setup (ready to use out of the box).
You configure servers manually.	Comes with an embedded server like Tomcat.
More complex to start with.	Beginner-friendly and faster to develop.
Requires XML for configuration.	Uses annotations and Java-based configuration.
Example to Understand
With Spring (Manual Setup):
You need to configure:
The server (Tomcat or Jetty).
Application settings.
Dependencies (manually adding them to files).
With Spring Boot:
Imagine you want to build a To-Do List App:
Spring Boot has templates to quickly set up the project.
The server is already built-in.
You just write your code, and it works immediately.
When to Use Spring or Spring Boot?
Use Spring Boot if you want to quickly build and run applications.
Use Spring if you need fine-grained control and customization for enterprise-grade projects.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a simple comparison of Spring and Spring Boot:

Spring Framework:
Core Framework:

It's a comprehensive framework for building Java applications.
Provides tools for dependency injection, AOP, data access, transaction management, and more.
Configuration:

Requires a lot of manual configuration using XML or annotations.
Developers need to set up application servers and libraries.
Flexibility:

Offers great flexibility but requires more effort to integrate tools like Hibernate, JMS, etc.
No Embedded Server:

Does not come with an embedded server; you need to deploy the application on servers like Tomcat or Jetty.
Spring Boot:
Built on Spring:

It's a layer on top of the Spring framework, making it easier to use.
Auto-Configuration:

Provides auto-configuration to reduce manual setup.
Helps developers skip boilerplate configuration.
Embedded Server:

Comes with an embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow server, allowing you to run applications without an external server.
Opinionated Defaults:

Provides sensible defaults for common configurations, but you can customize them if needed.
Ready-to-Use Starter Dependencies:

Offers "starter" packages like spring-boot-starter-web to include dependencies for web applications.
Spring Boot CLI:

Allows quick application creation with Groovy scripts.
When to Use?
Use Spring if you need more control and customization for complex applications.
Use Spring Boot for rapid application development, especially for microservices or simple applications, as it simplifies and speeds up the development process.
Let me know if you'd like examples or deeper explanations!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Spring Boot, the web dependency is a feature that helps you build web applications, such as websites or REST APIs.

When you add the Spring Web dependency to your project, it provides you with tools to:

Handle HTTP requests and responses: For example, you can create a REST API that responds to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests.
Use MVC architecture: It helps you organize your code into controllers (to handle requests), services (to process logic), and models (to represent data).
Embed a web server: Spring Boot includes an embedded server (like Tomcat) so your application can run immediately without needing extra setup.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Annotations
@Component
When you add @Component to a class, Spring will:

Create an object (or bean) of that class for you.
Manage it, so you don't have to manually create or destroy the object.
It simplifies your code by letting Spring handle object creation and management. 
This is super useful in larger projects where managing objects yourself can become messy.
------
@Autowired

In Spring Framework, @Autowired is an annotation that tells Spring:

"Hey, find the required bean (object) and automatically inject it into this class where I need it."
It helps you avoid manually creating or passing objects. Spring will connect or wire the dependent objects for you.
------
@Qualifier
In Spring, @Qualifier works with @Autowired to solve a specific problem:

What if there are multiple beans of the same type?
@Qualifier tells Spring which specific bean to inject when thereâ€™s more than one option.
How It Works in Code

Example Without @Qualifier:
java

public interface cake {}
Copy code
@Component
public class ChocolateCake implements Cake {}

@Component
public class VanillaCake implements Cake {}

@Service
public class CakeService {
    @Autowired
    private Cake cake; // ERROR: Spring doesn't know which cake to inject!
}


Example With @Qualifier:
java
Copy code
@Component("chocolateCake")
public class ChocolateCake {}

@Component("vanillaCake")
public class VanillaCake {}

@Service
public class CakeService {
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("chocolateCake") // Specify which bean to inject.
    private Cake cake;
}


Here, Spring knows to inject the ChocolateCake bean into CakeService.


Confusion happens when:
Multiple beans have the same type (directly or via a parent class/interface).
Spring needs a way to know which bean to inject.
Use @Qualifier to tell Spring the exact bean name

------
@Scope
Singleton (Default):

One object shared across the entire application.
Example: A shared service used by all parts of the app.
Prototype:

Creates a new object every time the bean is requested.
Example: When you need a separate instance for each user request.

------
@PostConstruct
In Spring, @PostConstruct is an annotation used to mark a method that should run immediately after the bean is created and dependency injection is done. It's like saying:

"After you set everything up for this bean, run this method."
Why Use @PostConstruct?
Itâ€™s typically used for:

Initialization tasks (like setting up resources or validating configurations).
Running code once after the bean is ready.

------
@Predestroy

In Spring, @PreDestroy is an annotation used to mark a method that should run just before the bean is destroyed. Itâ€™s like saying:

"Before this bean is removed, clean up resources or perform some final tasks."
Why Use @PreDestroy?
Itâ€™s typically used for:

Releasing resources (e.g., closing database connections, stopping threads).
Performing cleanup tasks before the bean is destroyed.


------
@SpringBootApplication  // need to learn about this later

What is @SpringBootApplication?
@SpringBootApplication is a key annotation in Spring Boot. It combines three annotations:

@EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism.
Enables auto-configuration (e.g., setting up an embedded server like Tomcat).
@ComponentScan: Automatically scans the package for components, services, and configurations.
@Configuration: Indicates that the class is a configuration class where beans can be defined.
This annotation tells Spring Boot to start your application, configure everything automatically, and look for components in your code.

------
@Service


What is @Service in Spring?
@Service is an annotation in Spring used to indicate that a class provides business logic (service layer functionality).
It helps in organizing the application into logical layers like controllers, services, and repositories.

Key Features:
Specialized Component: It is a specialization of @Component. Spring detects it during component scanning and registers it as a bean.
Business Logic: Typically used to write the core business logic of the application.
Dependency Injection: Makes it easier to inject the service into other layers like controllers.

Separates business logic from other layers like the controller or repository.
Promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

So, @Service bridges the controller (user interaction) and repository (data handling) layers by processing the business logic in between.
------
@Controller
@Controller is a Spring annotation that is used to define a controller in a web application. It is part of the presentation layer 
and is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them (with help from services), and returning a view (like HTML, JSP, or Thymeleaf) as a response.

Key Features of @Controller:
Handles Requests:

Maps HTTP requests (like GET, POST) to specific methods using annotations like @GetMapping or @PostMapping.
Returns a View:

Used for applications where the response is a view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
It returns the name of the view to be rendered.
Part of MVC:

Works as the Controller in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

------
@Repository

What is @Repository in Spring?
@Repository is an annotation in Spring used to indicate that a class is a Data Access Object (DAO). 
These classes are responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

It is part of the persistence layer in an application and is used in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

Key Features of @Repository:
Database Interaction:
Used to fetch, save, update, or delete data in the database.
Specialized @Component:
It is a specialization of @Component. Spring automatically detects it and registers it as a bean.
Exception Translation:
Converts database-specific exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException.
------
@Bean

What is @Bean in Spring?
@Bean is an annotation in Spring used to define and manage Spring beans (objects). 
It tells the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and manage a method's return value as a bean.

It is usually used in a @Configuration class to create custom beans for the application.
------
@RequestMapping

What is @RequestMapping in Spring?
@RequestMapping is an annotation in Spring used to map HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific methods in a controller class. 
It tells the controller which URL the user is trying to access and what method to execute.
It can be applied at the class level (to map a base URL) or method level (to map specific endpoints).

------
Model View Controller
What is MVC?
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a design pattern used to organize code in a way that separates the logic, 
user interface, and user input into three different components. This helps to keep the code clean and organized.

MVC Breakdown:
Model:

What it does: Represents the data or business logic of your application.
Example: A Product class that stores product details like name, price, and description.
View:

What it does: Handles the display or the UI (User Interface). It shows data to the user.
Example: A webpage or a screen showing a list of products.
Controller:

What it does: Acts as a middleman between the Model and the View. It handles the user input (like button clicks or URL requests) and updates the Model or View accordingly.
Example: A method that receives a request like "show all products," gets the product data from the Model, and sends it to the View to display.
How MVC Works Together:
User Interaction:

The user makes a request (like clicking a button or entering a URL).
Controller:

The Controller handles that request and asks the Model for data.
Model:

The Model fetches the necessary data (like from a database) and returns it.
View:

The Controller sends the data to the View, and the View displays it to the user.
----------------------------------------------
JSP stands for JavaServer Pages. 
It is a technology used to create dynamic web pages in Java. 
JSP allows you to embed Java code directly into HTML pages to generate dynamic content based on user requests.

Why Use JSP?
Dynamic Content: Allows you to create web pages that can change based on user interaction or server-side data.
Java Integration: Easy integration with Java classes and libraries for tasks like database access.
Separation of Concerns: JSP allows you to separate the presentation (HTML) from the logic (Java), though this is usually improved further by frameworks like Spring MVC.

JSP vs. HTML:
HTML is static, meaning it cannot change based on user interaction or data without other tools (like JavaScript).
JSP can generate dynamic content by mixing Java code with HTML, enabling you to display different content based on conditions or user input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MVC only

package com.example.website.web;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller//it can handle http request and returns responses  typically html or jsp
//defines this class as a Spring MVC controller.
public class HomeController {
 @RequestMapping("/home")
 public String getHomePage() {
     return "home";
 }
}


@RequestMapping("/home"): This annotation maps the URL /home to the getHomePage method.
 When a user visits http://yourdomain.com/home, this method will handle the request.
public String getHomePage() { ... }: This method returns a String, which represents the name of the view to render.
return "home";: This line returns the view name "home". Spring looks for a view file (like home.html or home.jsp) 
in the configured view folder, renders it, and sends it as the response.



@RequestMapping("/signUp")
public String getSignUpPage(Model uiModel) {  //Model holds data that can be passed to the view
    User user = userService.getUser();
    uiModel.addAttribute("user", user);
    return "signup";
}

model
In the context of Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications, 
the model is the part that holds the data and represents the business logic of the application.
 It's a way to organize and store data that is shared between the controller and the view.
 
When you add data to the model in a controller, 
it becomes available to the view (like a JSP or Thymeleaf template), which then uses that data to render the final webpage.



-----------------------------------------------
@RequestMapping("/registerUser")
public String createdUser(@ModelAttribute(value = "user") StudentUser studentUser) {
    int userId = userService.signUp(studentUser.getName(), studentUser.getGender(), studentUser.getLocation(), studentUser.getCollege());
    if(userId != -1) {
        ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("redirect:welcome?id=" + userId);
        return modelAndView.getViewName();
    }
    return "signup";
}



When we use @ModelAttribute, weâ€™re telling Spring to "connect" or "link" data from a form 
(like the values someone enters on a webpage) to a Java object. This way, we donâ€™t have to manually pick each value
 from the form; Spring does it for us automatically.

-----------------------------------------------
 
 What is ModelAndView?
Think of ModelAndView as a "package" that contains:

The webpage you want to show.
The data you want to send to that webpa
Example:
Imagine you are sending a birthday greeting:

You need to tell your friend which greeting card to open (this is the "webpage").
You also need to tell your friend what to write on the card (this is the "data").
ModelAndView helps you do both things at the same time


"redirect:welcome?id=" + userId:

redirect:: This tells Spring to redirect the user to a new URL instead of just rendering a page. This is like telling the browser, "Go to this new page."
"welcome?id=" + userId: After the redirect:, we define the new page to go to, which in this case is the "welcome" page.
?id=" + userId: We are adding a query parameter id to the URL. This will pass the value of userId to the welcome page.
For example, if userId = 123, the new URL will be /welcome?id=123.

-----------------------------------------------

What is ModelMap?
ModelMap is a container used to hold data that you want to send from your controller 
to the view (webpage). It allows you to add key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the data and the value is 
the actual data itself. You can think of it as a box where you place data that will later be used in the view.
 
 
 map.addAttribute("userId", userID);:

This adds the userID to the ModelMap with the name "userId".
This means the data (userID, like "123") will be available in the view and can be accessed by the name "userId".
 
 
----------------------------------------------- 
 What is @RequestParam?
@RequestParam is an annotation used in Spring MVC to get data that is passed 
from the URL or form to the controller method. It helps you retrieve query parameters from the URL or form input fields.

Simple Example:
Imagine you have a URL like this:

http://example.com/welcome?id=123
In this URL, id=123 is the query parameter. @RequestParam can help you get the value of this parameter (in this case, 123) in your controller method.

Code Example:
java
Copy code
@RequestMapping("/welcome")
public String ShowWelcomePage(@RequestParam("id") String userID) {
    // userID will be 123 from the URL http://example.com/welcome?id=123
    return "welcome";
}
----------------------------------------------- 

Difference between ModelAttribute and RequestParam

Purpose
@RequestParam:

Used to retrieve individual query parameters or form data by name from the URL or request.
Ideal for simple data types like strings, integers, etc.
@ModelAttribute:

Used to bind an entire model object with data from the form or request.
Suitable for complex objects (like a User or Order object) where you have multiple fields (name, age, location, etc.).
Automatically maps the request data to the fields of the object


-----------------------------------------------

ChatGPT
In Spring MVC, request.getAttribute() is used to retrieve data stored in the request scope. When you use request.setAttribute("name", value),
youâ€™re adding data to the request so that you can pass information from one part of your code (e.g., a controller) to another (e.g., a view like JSP) for that specific request only.

For example:

Set attribute in a controller:

java
Copy code
request.setAttribute("greeting", "Hello, Venkatesh!");
This line stores the value "Hello, Venkatesh!" in the request with the name greeting.

Get attribute in a view (e.g., JSP):

java
Copy code
String message = (String) request.getAttribute("greeting");
This retrieves the greeting attribute from the request, so message will hold "Hello, Venkatesh!".

This is helpful when you want to share data for the duration of a single HTTP request, such as passing data from the controller to the view to be displayed to the user.

 
-----------------------------------------------

In Spring MVC, @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URL and pass them as parameters to a controller method.

Imagine you have a URL like this:

bash
Copy code
/user/123
In this case, 123 could be an ID for a user. You can set up a controller method to capture that value directly from the URL using @PathVariable.

Here's how it works:

Define a URL pattern with a placeholder in your controller:

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUserById(@PathVariable("id") int userId) {
    // Now, userId will have the value 123 when the URL is /user/123
    // Do something with userId, like fetching user data from a database
    return "userProfile";
}
In the URL /user/123, Spring will automatically match 123 to {id} and assign it to the userId parameter.

In simple terms, @PathVariable lets you take part of the URL and use it directly in your method, making it easy to handle dynamic data in URLs.

------------------------------------------------------------


What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a menu in a restaurant:

It tells you what dishes you can order (what a system can do).
You don't need to know how the food is prepared (how the system works internally).
You just order from the menu, and the restaurant (system) does the work for you.
In the tech world, an API allows two systems to communicate with each other and exchange data.

What is a REST API?
REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a specific type of API that
follows some rules (principles) to allow communication between a client (e.g., your browser) and a server (e.g., a website's backend).

It uses standard HTTP methods like:

GET: To get (retrieve) data.
POST: To create new data.
PUT: To update existing data.
DELETE: To delete data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

In Spring MVC, @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URL and pass them as parameters to a controller method.

Imagine you have a URL like this:

bash
Copy code
/user/123
In this case, 123 could be an ID for a user. You can set up a controller method to capture that value directly from the URL using @PathVariable.

Here's how it works:

Define a URL pattern with a placeholder in your controller:

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUserById(@PathVariable("id") int userId) {
    // Now, userId will have the value 123 when the URL is /user/123
    // Do something with userId, like fetching user data from a database
    return "userProfile";
}
In the URL /user/123, Spring will automatically match 123 to {id} and assign it to the userId parameter.

In simple terms, @PathVariable lets you take part of the URL and use it directly in your method, making it easy to handle dynamic data in URLs.

------------------------------------------------------------
Class-Level Annotation
@RestController

    Purpose: Tells Spring Boot that this class handles HTTP requests and sends back responses (usually as text or JSON).
    Effect: Every method in this class will return data as the response body, not a view (like in a website).
RestController is used for making restful web services with the help of the @RestController annotation. This annotation is used at the class level and allows the class to handle the requests made by the client. 


@RequestMapping("/project")

    Purpose: Sets a base URL for all endpoints in this class.
    Effect: All methods in this class will have URLs starting with /project.
    
Method-Level Annotations

    @RequestMapping("/hello")
        Purpose: Maps the URL /project/hello to this method.
        Effect: When someone visits /project/hello, the method runs and returns "Hello Coding Ninjas !"
        
 @GetMapping("/hello-world")

    Purpose: Maps the URL /project/hello-world to this method for HTTP GET requests only.
    Effect: When a GET request is sent to /project/hello-world, the method runs and returns "Hello from Earth !".
    Difference from @RequestMapping: @GetMapping is specific to GET requests, while @RequestMapping can handle multiple types (GET, POST, etc.).

       
        
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is @PathVariable?

@PathVariable is an annotation in Spring Boot used to capture values from the URL and pass them into your method as variables.
--------------------------------------------------------

@PostMapping is an annotation in Spring Boot used to map HTTP POST requests to a specific method in your controller class.

Simple Explanation:
When a client (like a browser or app) sends a POST request to your server, @PostMapping helps the server handle that request.
It is typically used when the client wants to send data (like a form or JSON) to the server, usually to create or save something.


@PostMapping("/addUser"): Handles POST requests sent to the "/addUser" endpoint.
@RequestBody User user: Captures the data sent by the client (e.g., JSON) and converts it into a User object.
Response: Returns a message after processing.
Use @PostMapping whenever you need to send data to your server for operations like adding a record, submitting a form, or uploading something.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
@DeleteMapping
In Spring Boot, @DeleteMapping is an annotation used in RESTful APIs to
handle HTTP DELETE requests. It is typically used to delete a resource (like a record in a database).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@PutMapping
In Spring Boot, @PutMapping is an annotation used in a REST API to handle HTTP PUT requests. It is generally used to update an existing resource.

Hereâ€™s a simple way to understand it:

    PUT is like editing or updating something. For example, if you already have a profile with your name and you want to update it with a new name, a PUT request is sent.
    @PutMapping maps this PUT request to a specific method in your controller so that it can handle the update logic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ResponseStatus is an annotation in Spring Boot that is used to tell the application to return a specific HTTP status code when a method or exception is invoked.

Simple Explanation:
Imagine your application is responding to a user. Instead of just saying "Something went wrong", you want to send more specific information like:

"Not Found" (404)
"Bad Request" (400)
"Internal Server Error" (500)
The @ResponseStatus annotation helps you do this easily and clearly by linking a particular exception or method to a specific status code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ObjectUtils.isEmpty() is a utility method provided by Spring Framework to check whether an object is empty or null. 
It is commonly used to avoid writing repetitive null and empty checks in your code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Spring Boot, @Size, @Min, and @Max are used for validation to ensure that input data meets certain criteria:

@Size: Ensures the size (length) of a string, collection, or array is within a specified range.
Example: @Size(min = 3, max = 10) â†’ Input length must be between 3 and 10.

@Min: Ensures a number is not smaller than the specified minimum value.
Example: @Min(18) â†’ Input value must be at least 18.

@Max: Ensures a number is not larger than the specified maximum value.
Example: @Max(100) â†’ Input value must not exceed 100.

These annotations work with Spring Boot's Bean Validation framework (Hibernate Validator by default). They are applied to class fields in DTOs or models.

@Valid in Spring Boot is slightly differentâ€”it is used to trigger the validation process.

When you annotate a method parameter or field with @Valid, Spring Boot checks if the constraints (like @Size, @Min, @Max) on the object or its fields are satisfied. If the validation fails, an error is thrown.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BindingResult
Validation is applied to the model object (e.g., using @Valid or @Validated).
Any errors during validation are captured in the BindingResult object.
You can check the BindingResult for validation errors and take appropriate actions, such as displaying error messages or returning specific responses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
REST template

In Spring, the RestTemplate is a class that makes it easy to communicate with other web services (like APIs). You can think of it as a helper that lets your Java program send HTTP requests and get responses. It is part of Spring's web module.

What can it do?
Send HTTP Requests: You can send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Get Responses: It lets you fetch data from APIs or send data to them.
Example:
Imagine you're building an app, and you want to get weather data from a public API. RestTemplate helps you send the request to the API and handle the response.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP method
An HTTP method is a way for your computer to tell a web server what kind of action it wants to perform.
Think of it as a specific type of "request" when your app or browser talks to a website or API.

Common HTTP Methods:
GET:

Purpose: To fetch (read) data from the server.
Example: Viewing a website or reading data from an API.
Analogy: Like asking for information (e.g., "Show me the weather details").
POST:

Purpose: To send (create) data to the server.
Example: Submitting a form or adding a new user to a database.
Analogy: Like filling out a form and submitting it (e.g., "Add this new user").
PUT:

Purpose: To update or replace existing data on the server.
Example: Changing your profile picture.
Analogy: Like replacing an old file with a new one (e.g., "Update this userâ€™s information").
DELETE:

Purpose: To delete data from the server.
Example: Removing your account.
Analogy: Like throwing something away (e.g., "Delete this file").
PATCH:

Purpose: To partially update data (only a part of the data is changed).
Example: Updating just your email in a user profile.
Analogy: Like correcting a single word in a document without rewriting the whole thing.
Summary:
HTTP methods are instructions you give to a server:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In simple terms, private final RestTemplate restTemplate is creating an object of the RestTemplate class,
which is commonly used in Spring Boot applications to make HTTP requests to external APIs or web services.
Imagine your application needs to get data from another website or API. The RestTemplate helps you do that with just a few lines of code:

restTemplateBuilder:
This is an instance of the RestTemplateBuilder class, which is provided by Spring Boot. It is a helper class that makes it easy to configure and create a RestTemplate object.
For example, you can use RestTemplateBuilder to add default configurations like timeouts, authentication details, interceptors, etc.

.build():
This method of RestTemplateBuilder actually creates a fully configured RestTemplate object. It takes into account any custom settings or configurations added to the builder.

URL Construction

String url = "http://localhost:8080/rating/id";

    This is the base URL where the server is running (on localhost at port 8080).
    "http://localhost:8080/rating/id" is the API endpoint, but itâ€™s incomplete because you need to add the specific id you want to fetch the rating for.

For example:
If id = "123", the final URL will be:
http://localhost:8080/rating/id123


This code defines a method getRating(String id) that fetches a rating from a server (API) using the RestTemplate and returns it. Letâ€™s break it into simple steps:
1. Method Signature

public long getRating(String id)

    This is a method that takes a String called id as input (e.g., a user ID or product ID).
    It returns a long value, which represents the rating.

2. URL Construction

String url = "http://localhost:8080/rating/id";

    This is the base URL where the server is running (on localhost at port 8080).
    "http://localhost:8080/rating/id" is the API endpoint, but itâ€™s incomplete because you need to add the specific id you want to fetch the rating for.

For example:
If id = "123", the final URL will be:
http://localhost:8080/rating/id123
3. Making the API Call

ResponseEntity<Long> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(url + id, Long.class);

    restTemplate.getForEntity() is making an HTTP GET request to the server.
    url + id: Combines the base URL and the id to form the full URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/rating/id123).
    Long.class: This tells the method to expect the server's response to be a number (of type Long).

The response from the server is stored in a ResponseEntity<Long> object.
ResponseEntity is like a wrapper that contains:

    The actual data (in this case, the rating as a Long).
    Metadata (like HTTP status code).

4. Extracting the Data

return response.getBody();

    response.getBody() extracts the actual rating value from the ResponseEntity.
    This value is then returned as the output of the method.

------------------------------------------------

@Autowired
public RatingServiceCommunicator(RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder) {
    this.restTemplate = restTemplateBuilder.build();
}


The @Autowired annotation ensures that the RestTemplateBuilder (managed by Spring) is automatically injected into the constructor.
This injected builder is then used to create a RestTemplate object, which can be used for making HTTP requests.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Long ratingResponse = restTemplate.getForObject(url + id, Long.class);
Explanation:
RestTemplate:
This is a class in Spring used to make HTTP requests to other web services or APIs. Think of it as a tool to communicate with another server.

getForObject():
This method is used to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and expects to receive a response from the server. 
The response is then automatically converted into the type you specify (in this case, Long).

url + id:
The url is the base URL of the web service you are calling. By adding id to it, you are creating the full URL to fetch specific data for that id. For example:

java
Copy code
url = "http://example.com/api/ratings/";
id = 123;
// Full URL becomes: "http://example.com/api/ratings/123"
Long.class:
This tells RestTemplate that the response from the server should be converted into a Long data type. For example, if the server returns the number 100, it will be stored as a Long.

ratingResponse:
This is the variable where the server's response (a Long value) will be stored.

In Simple Words:
You're sending a GET request to a server at url + id.
The server responds with a number (e.g., 100), which is automatically converted into a Long.
This number is then stored in the variable ratingResponse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
restTemplate.postForObject(url, ratingMap, Object.class);


url: This is the endpoint (API or web service) where the data will be sent.
ratingMap: This is the actual data you want to send in the POST request. Itâ€™s usually a Map or an object with the information you want to send.
Object.class: This tells the method what type of response to expect from the server. In this case, it expects any generic Object.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HttpEntity requestEntity = new HttpEntity(ratingMap);
restTemplate.exchange(url, HttpMethod.POST, requestEntity, Object.class);

Explanation:
HttpEntity requestEntity = new HttpEntity(ratingMap);:

HttpEntity: This is a container that holds:
The body of your request (in this case, ratingMap).
Optional headers (like content type, authentication, etc.).
Here, you are wrapping the ratingMap (your data) inside an HttpEntity to prepare it for sending as part of the request.
restTemplate.exchange(...):

This is a flexible method to send any type of HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and handle the response.
Parameters:

url: The endpoint (API or web service) where you are sending the request.
HttpMethod.POST: Specifies the HTTP method as POST. Youâ€™re sending data to the server.
requestEntity: The HttpEntity you created earlier, which contains the data (ratingMap) and optionally headers.
Object.class: Indicates the type of response you expect back from the server. Here, itâ€™s a generic Object.
What it does:

It sends the ratingMap as the body of a POST request to the specified url.
It receives the serverâ€™s response, which is converted to an Object (or whatever type you specify instead of Object.class).
Example in simple steps:
Think of it like preparing a package (your ratingMap data) for delivery.
You pack the data into a box (HttpEntity).
Then, you send it to the destination (url) using the POST method (HttpMethod.POST).
Once delivered, you wait for the response (e.g., "Package received!"), which you handle as a generic object (Object.class).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Message Convertors

In Spring, message converters are used to convert data between objects and various formats 
(like JSON, XML, or plain text) so that your application can send and receive data in a way that other systems understand.

Key Points in Simple Terms:
Why use message converters?

When you send or receive data in a Spring application, itâ€™s usually in formats like JSON or XML. 
A message converter converts these formats into Java objects or vice versa.

MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter: Converts between Java objects and JSON.
Jaxb2RootElementHttpMessageConverter: Converts between Java objects and XML.
StringHttpMessageConverter: Converts plain text to/from Java objects.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Hibernate

Hibernate is a Java framework that helps you work with databases in a simpler and more efficient way.
Instead of writing a lot of SQL queries to interact with the database, Hibernate allows you to work with objects in Java.
It automatically takes care of converting these objects into database tables and vice versa. This process is called Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
Hereâ€™s a simple example to understand:

Imagine you have a Java class called Student with fields like id, name, and age.
In a database, you might have a table called students with columns id, name, and age.
Normally, youâ€™d write SQL queries to insert, update, or retrieve data from the students table.
With Hibernate:

You just use the Student class in your code, and Hibernate will handle the SQL part for you.
Hibernate maps the Student class to the students table automatically.
You donâ€™t need to manually write SQL queries for most tasks. Hibernate does it behind the scenes.
Why use Hibernate?
Reduces Boilerplate Code: You donâ€™t need to write repetitive SQL queries.
Database Independence: Hibernate works with many databases (like MySQL, Oracle, etc.), so switching databases is easier.
Handles Complex Relationships: It simplifies working with relationships between tables like one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.
How does it work?
Configuration: You tell Hibernate how your Java class corresponds to the database table using an XML file or annotations in the code.
Session: Hibernate uses a Session to connect to the database and perform operations like save, update, delete, etc.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Entity
In Spring Boot, the @Entity annotation is used to map a Java class to a database table. This annotation comes from JPA (Java Persistence API),
which is a part of the Hibernate framework (used for ORM - Object Relational Mapping).
Key Points:

    What does @Entity do?
        It tells Hibernate (or JPA) that this class is a database entity, meaning it will correspond to a table in the database.

    Requirements:
        The class must have a no-argument constructor (default constructor).
        The class must have a primary key, annotated with @Id.
        The fields of the class will be mapped to the columns of the table.

    Database Table Name:
        By default, the table name will be the same as the class name. You can customize it using the @Table annotation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Table(name = "student")
This tells Hibernate, "This Java class is mapped to a database table called student."
Example: If your class is called Student, Hibernate knows it corresponds to the student table in the database.

 @Column
This tells Hibernate, "This field in the Java class should be treated as a column in the database table."
If you donâ€™t specify anything inside @Column, Hibernate will use the field name (e.g., name, age) as the column name.
Example:
java
Copy code
@Column
private String name; 
Hibernate maps the name field in your Java class to a column named name in the database.


@Id
This marks a field as the primary key of the table.
Hibernate uses this field to uniquely identify each row in the database.
4. @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
This tells Hibernate, "Automatically generate values for the primary key."
The strategy = GenerationType.AUTO means:
Hibernate will decide how to generate the primary key values (e.g., using a sequence, an auto-increment field, etc.), depending on the database youâ€™re using.
Example: If you insert a new row, Hibernate will automatically assign an ID like 1, 2, 3, and so on.

----------------------------------------------------------
1. AUTO
What it does: Hibernate decides the best generation strategy based on the database being used.
How it works:
It could use IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, or TABLE depending on the database.
Example: For MySQL, it might use IDENTITY; for Oracle, it might use SEQUENCE.
2. IDENTITY
What it does: The database handles ID generation by automatically incrementing the primary key.
How it works:
For each new row, the database automatically generates a unique ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
When to use: When your database supports auto-increment columns (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server).
Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
3. SEQUENCE
What it does: Uses a database sequence to generate IDs.
How it works:
A sequence is a special database object that generates unique values.
Hibernate uses the sequence to get the next value for the ID.
When to use: When your database supports sequences (e.g., Oracle, PostgreSQL).
Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE SEQUENCE student_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
Hibernate will fetch the next value from student_seq for each new row.
4. TABLE
What it does: Creates a separate table to store and manage the IDs.
How it works:
A special table is created (e.g., hibernate_sequence) where Hibernate keeps track of the next ID value.
For every new row, Hibernate updates this table to get and increment the ID.
When to use: When your database doesn't support auto-increment or sequences.
Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE hibernate_sequence (
    sequence_name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    next_val INT
);

--------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a Transaction?
Transaction in Hibernate or Spring refers to a set of operations that are executed as a single unit of work.
Think of it like this: If you are transferring money from one account to another, the entire process (debit from one account and credit to another) 
should either complete fully or not happen at all. This ensures data consistency.
Example of a transaction:
Begin Transaction: Start the money transfer.
Perform Operations: Deduct money from Account A and add it to Account B.
Commit Transaction: Save these changes permanently.
Rollback Transaction: If something goes wrong (e.g., system crash), undo all changes.
In Hibernate or Spring:

Transactions ensure that database operations (like save, update, or delete) are consistent and reliable.
It uses ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to maintain integrity.
What is a Session?
A Session is like a connection between your application and the database in Hibernate.
Imagine it as a workspace where you can perform operations like adding, reading, or modifying data before saving changes to the database.
Key Points:
A Session is short-lived and represents a single unit of work with the database.
It acts as a bridge between the application and the database for interacting with data.
How They Work Together:
A Session is opened to interact with the database.
Within the Session, you start a Transaction to perform one or more database operations (like saving or deleting objects).
You commit or rollback the Transaction depending on whether the operations were successful or not.
Finally, the Session is closed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What does @Transactional do?

When you annotate a method or class with @Transactional, Spring:

    Begins a transaction when the method starts.
    Commits the transaction if the method completes successfully.
    Rolls back the transaction if an exception occurs.

This helps prevent partial updates in the database.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
public void save(Student student) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    Session session = entityManager.unwrap(Session.class);
    session.save(student);
}
Explanation:
Method Purpose:
This method is used to save a Student object into the database.
When you call this method and pass a Student object, it will insert the details of the student into the database table.
Session session = entityManager.unwrap(Session.class);:
The entityManager is a JPA EntityManager object used to manage database operations in Java Persistence API (JPA).
unwrap(Session.class) is a way to convert the EntityManager into a Hibernate Session.
Hibernate's Session provides more advanced database operations, like saving, updating, or deleting data, which are not always directly available in JPA.
This step essentially gives you access to Hibernate's Session, which is required to work directly with Hibernate methods like save().
session.save(student);:
The save() method is a Hibernate-specific method that:
Takes the Student object (an instance of a Java class).
Converts it into a database record (a row in the Student table).
Inserts the data into the database.
For example, if your Student object contains name="John" and age=20, Hibernate will generate an INSERT SQL query to store this data in the Student table.
How it Works:
You call this save() method with a Student object.
The EntityManager is converted to a Hibernate Session.
Hibernate uses its save() method to generate and execute an INSERT SQL query.
The Student data gets stored in the database.
Why is EntityManager.unwrap(Session.class) Used?
In some cases, you may want to use Hibernate-specific features, like save() or update(), which are not part of JPA.
To access these features, you need to "unwrap" the EntityManager into a Hibernate Session.

---------------------------------------------------------------
In application.yml file

Breaking It Down:
spring.datasource.url:
This specifies the database location (where the MySQL database is running).
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sk_company:
localhost means the database is on your own computer.
3306 is the default port number MySQL uses to listen for connections.
sk_company is the name of the database you're connecting to.
spring.datasource.username:
This is the username required to connect to the database.
In this case, the username is root (default for MySQL).
spring.datasource.password:
This is the password for the database.
Here, the password is mysql@123.
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate-dialect:
This tells Hibernate which SQL dialect to use.
org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect:
Hibernate needs to know how to generate SQL queries specific to MySQL.
The "dialect" is like a translator that helps Hibernate speak the "language" of MySQL.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto:
This controls how Hibernate manages the database schema (e.g., creating or updating tables).
update:
Hibernate will update the database schema automatically when the application runs.
For example, if you add a new field to an entity, Hibernate will update the corresponding database table to include that new column.



What is a Hibernate Dialect?
A dialect is like a translator that Hibernate uses to generate database-specific SQL queries.
Every database (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) has its own rules and syntax for SQL queries.
The Hibernate Dialect tells Hibernate how to write SQL in the "language" that a specific database understands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Query Method

In Hibernate, the createQuery method is used to write HQL (Hibernate Query Language) or JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) queries. 
It allows us to retrieve or manipulate data in the database.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation with an example:

Step 1: What is createQuery?
createQuery is used to create a query object to execute HQL, 
which is similar to SQL but operates on entity objects instead of database tables.

Step 2: How does it work?
Write the HQL query: HQL is written based on the entity class and its fields, not on database table names or columns.
Execute the query: Once the query is created, you execute it to get the result.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Session session = entityManager.unwrap(Session.class);
List<Event> allEvents = session.createQuery("select v from Event v ", Event.class).getResultList();
return allEvents;

entityManager.unwrap(Session.class)
The entityManager is a JPA (Java Persistence API) object used to interact with the database.
JPA doesn't directly expose all methods of the Hibernate Session (which is more powerful).
The unwrap(Session.class) method converts the entityManager into a Hibernate Session, so you can use Hibernate-specific features like createQuery.
2. session.createQuery("select v from Event v", Event.class)
This creates a query to fetch data from the Event table in the database.
"select v from Event v":
This is JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language), which is similar to SQL but works with entities (Java objects) instead of database tables.
It says: "Select all rows from the Event table and map them to the Event class."
v: This is an alias (temporary name) for each row in the query result.
3. .getResultList()
This method executes the query and retrieves the results as a list of Event objects.
Each row in the database is converted into an instance of the Event class.
4. return allEvents
Finally, the method returns the list of all events fetched from the database.
Full Explanation in Simple Words
You are taking the entityManager and converting it into a Hibernate Session to use its advanced query features.
You write a query to fetch all rows from the Event table.
Each row is converted into an Event object and stored in a list.
The list of Event objects is returned to the caller.
