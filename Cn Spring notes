Here's a simple comparison of Spring and Spring Boot:

Spring Framework:
Core Framework:

It's a comprehensive framework for building Java applications.
Provides tools for dependency injection, AOP, data access, transaction management, and more.
Configuration:

Requires a lot of manual configuration using XML or annotations.
Developers need to set up application servers and libraries.
Flexibility:

Offers great flexibility but requires more effort to integrate tools like Hibernate, JMS, etc.
No Embedded Server:

Does not come with an embedded server; you need to deploy the application on servers like Tomcat or Jetty.
Spring Boot:
Built on Spring:

It's a layer on top of the Spring framework, making it easier to use.
Auto-Configuration:

Provides auto-configuration to reduce manual setup.
Helps developers skip boilerplate configuration.
Embedded Server:

Comes with an embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow server, allowing you to run applications without an external server.
Opinionated Defaults:

Provides sensible defaults for common configurations, but you can customize them if needed.
Ready-to-Use Starter Dependencies:

Offers "starter" packages like spring-boot-starter-web to include dependencies for web applications.
Spring Boot CLI:

Allows quick application creation with Groovy scripts.
When to Use?
Use Spring if you need more control and customization for complex applications.
Use Spring Boot for rapid application development, especially for microservices or simple applications, as it simplifies and speeds up the development process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Annotations
@Component
When you add @Component to a class, Spring will:

Create an object (or bean) of that class for you.
Manage it, so you don't have to manually create or destroy the object.
It simplifies your code by letting Spring handle object creation and management. 
This is super useful in larger projects where managing objects yourself can become messy.
------
@Autowired

In Spring Framework, @Autowired is an annotation that tells Spring:

"Hey, find the required bean (object) and automatically inject it into this class where I need it."
It helps you avoid manually creating or passing objects. Spring will connect or wire the dependent objects for you.
------
@Qualifier
In Spring, @Qualifier works with @Autowired to solve a specific problem:

What if there are multiple beans of the same type?
@Qualifier tells Spring which specific bean to inject when there’s more than one option.

   @Component
public class PaidCourse implements Course {
	String courseName;
	@Autowired
	@Qualifier("javaInstructor")
	Instructor courseInstructor;
	@Autowired
	UserList userList;
// additional methods
}
Confusion happens when:
Multiple beans have the same type (directly or via a parent class/interface).
Spring needs a way to know which bean to inject.
Use @Qualifier to tell Spring the exact bean name

------
@Scope
Singleton (Default):

One object shared across the entire application.
Example: A shared service used by all parts of the app.
Prototype:

Creates a new object every time the bean is requested.
Example: When you need a separate instance for each user request.

------
@PostConstruct
In Spring, @PostConstruct is an annotation used to mark a method that should run immediately after the bean is created and dependency injection is done. It's like saying:

"After you set everything up for this bean, run this method."
Why Use @PostConstruct?
It’s typically used for:

Initialization tasks (like setting up resources or validating configurations).
Running code once after the bean is ready.

------
@Predestroy

In Spring, @PreDestroy is an annotation used to mark a method that should run just before the bean is destroyed. It’s like saying:

"Before this bean is removed, clean up resources or perform some final tasks."
Why Use @PreDestroy?
It’s typically used for:

Releasing resources (e.g., closing database connections, stopping threads).
Performing cleanup tasks before the bean is destroyed.


------
@SpringBootApplication  // need to learn about this later

What is @SpringBootApplication?
@SpringBootApplication is a key annotation in Spring Boot. It combines three annotations:

@EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism.
Enables auto-configuration (e.g., setting up an embedded server like Tomcat).
@ComponentScan: Automatically scans the package for components, services, and configurations.
@Configuration: Indicates that the class is a configuration class where beans can be defined.
This annotation tells Spring Boot to start your application, configure everything automatically, and look for components in your code.

------
@Service


What is @Service in Spring?
@Service is an annotation in Spring used to indicate that a class provides business logic (service layer functionality).
It helps in organizing the application into logical layers like controllers, services, and repositories.

Key Features:
Specialized Component: It is a specialization of @Component. Spring detects it during component scanning and registers it as a bean.
Business Logic: Typically used to write the core business logic of the application.
Dependency Injection: Makes it easier to inject the service into other layers like controllers.

Separates business logic from other layers like the controller or repository.
Promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

So, @Service bridges the controller (user interaction) and repository (data handling) layers by processing the business logic in between.
------
@Controller
@Controller is a Spring annotation that is used to define a controller in a web application. It is part of the presentation layer and is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them (with help from services), and returning a view (like HTML, JSP, or Thymeleaf) as a response.

Key Features of @Controller:
Handles Requests:

Maps HTTP requests (like GET, POST) to specific methods using annotations like @GetMapping or @PostMapping.
Returns a View:

Used for applications where the response is a view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
It returns the name of the view to be rendered.
Part of MVC:

Works as the Controller in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

------
@Repository

What is @Repository in Spring?
@Repository is an annotation in Spring used to indicate that a class is a Data Access Object (DAO). 
These classes are responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

It is part of the persistence layer in an application and is used in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

Key Features of @Repository:
Database Interaction:
Used to fetch, save, update, or delete data in the database.
Specialized @Component:
It is a specialization of @Component. Spring automatically detects it and registers it as a bean.
Exception Translation:
Converts database-specific exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException.
------
@Bean

What is @Bean in Spring?
@Bean is an annotation in Spring used to define and manage Spring beans (objects). 
It tells the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and manage a method's return value as a bean.

It is usually used in a @Configuration class to create custom beans for the application.
------
@RequestMapping

What is @RequestMapping in Spring?
@RequestMapping is an annotation in Spring used to map HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific methods in a controller class. 
It tells the controller which URL the user is trying to access and what method to execute.
It can be applied at the class level (to map a base URL) or method level (to map specific endpoints).

------
Model View Controller
What is MVC?
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a design pattern used to organize code in a way that separates the logic, 
user interface, and user input into three different components. This helps to keep the code clean and organized.

MVC Breakdown:
Model:

What it does: Represents the data or business logic of your application.
Example: A Product class that stores product details like name, price, and description.
View:

What it does: Handles the display or the UI (User Interface). It shows data to the user.
Example: A webpage or a screen showing a list of products.
Controller:

What it does: Acts as a middleman between the Model and the View. It handles the user input (like button clicks or URL requests) and updates the Model or View accordingly.
Example: A method that receives a request like "show all products," gets the product data from the Model, and sends it to the View to display.
How MVC Works Together:
User Interaction:

The user makes a request (like clicking a button or entering a URL).
Controller:

The Controller handles that request and asks the Model for data.
Model:

The Model fetches the necessary data (like from a database) and returns it.
View:

The Controller sends the data to the View, and the View displays it to the user.
----------------------------------------------
JSP stands for JavaServer Pages. 
It is a technology used to create dynamic web pages in Java. 
JSP allows you to embed Java code directly into HTML pages to generate dynamic content based on user requests.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MVC only

package com.example.website.web;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller//it can handle http request and returns responses  typically html or jsp
//defines this class as a Spring MVC controller.
public class HomeController {
 @RequestMapping("/home")
 public String getHomePage() {
     return "home";
 }
}


@RequestMapping("/home"): This annotation maps the URL /home to the getHomePage method.
 When a user visits http://yourdomain.com/home, this method will handle the request.
public String getHomePage() { ... }: This method returns a String, which represents the name of the view to render.
return "home";: This line returns the view name "home". Spring looks for a view file (like home.html or home.jsp) in the configured view folder, renders it, and sends it as the response.



@RequestMapping("/signUp")
public String getSignUpPage(Model uiModel) {  //Model holds data that can be passed to the view
    User user = userService.getUser();
    uiModel.addAttribute("user", user);
    return "signup";
}

model
In the context of Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications, 
the model is the part that holds the data and represents the business logic of the application.
 It's a way to organize and store data that is shared between the controller and the view.
 
When you add data to the model in a controller, 
it becomes available to the view (like a JSP or Thymeleaf template), which then uses that data to render the final webpage.



-----------------------------------------------
@RequestMapping("/registerUser")
public String createdUser(@ModelAttribute(value = "user") StudentUser studentUser) {
    int userId = userService.signUp(studentUser.getName(), studentUser.getGender(), studentUser.getLocation(), studentUser.getCollege());
    if(userId != -1) {
        ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("redirect:welcome?id=" + userId);
        return modelAndView.getViewName();
    }
    return "signup";
}



When we use @ModelAttribute, we’re telling Spring to "connect" or "link" data from a form 
(like the values someone enters on a webpage) to a Java object. This way, we don’t have to manually pick each value
 from the form; Spring does it for us automatically.

-----------------------------------------------
 
 What is ModelAndView?
Think of ModelAndView as a "package" that contains:

The webpage you want to show.
The data you want to send to that webpa
Example:
Imagine you are sending a birthday greeting:

You need to tell your friend which greeting card to open (this is the "webpage").
You also need to tell your friend what to write on the card (this is the "data").
ModelAndView helps you do both things at the same time


"redirect:welcome?id=" + userId:

redirect:: This tells Spring to redirect the user to a new URL instead of just rendering a page. This is like telling the browser, "Go to this new page."
"welcome?id=" + userId: After the redirect:, we define the new page to go to, which in this case is the "welcome" page.
?id=" + userId: We are adding a query parameter id to the URL. This will pass the value of userId to the welcome page.
For example, if userId = 123, the new URL will be /welcome?id=123.

-----------------------------------------------

What is ModelMap?
ModelMap is a container used to hold data that you want to send from your controller 
to the view (webpage). It allows you to add key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the data and the value is 
the actual data itself. You can think of it as a box where you place data that will later be used in the view.
 
 
 map.addAttribute("userId", userID);:

This adds the userID to the ModelMap with the name "userId".
This means the data (userID, like "123") will be available in the view and can be accessed by the name "userId".
 
 
----------------------------------------------- 
 What is @RequestParam?
@RequestParam is an annotation used in Spring MVC to get data that is passed 
from the URL or form to the controller method. It helps you retrieve query parameters from the URL or form input fields.

Simple Example:
Imagine you have a URL like this:

http://example.com/welcome?id=123
In this URL, id=123 is the query parameter. @RequestParam can help you get the value of this parameter (in this case, 123) in your controller method.

Code Example:
java
Copy code
@RequestMapping("/welcome")
public String ShowWelcomePage(@RequestParam("id") String userID) {
    // userID will be 123 from the URL http://example.com/welcome?id=123
    return "welcome";
}
----------------------------------------------- 

Difference between ModelAttribute and RequestParam

Purpose
@RequestParam:

Used to retrieve individual query parameters or form data by name from the URL or request.
Ideal for simple data types like strings, integers, etc.
@ModelAttribute:

Used to bind an entire model object with data from the form or request.
Suitable for complex objects (like a User or Order object) where you have multiple fields (name, age, location, etc.).
Automatically maps the request data to the fields of the object


-----------------------------------------------

ChatGPT
In Spring MVC, request.getAttribute() is used to retrieve data stored in the request scope. When you use request.setAttribute("name", value), you’re adding data to the request so that you can pass information from one part of your code (e.g., a controller) to another (e.g., a view like JSP) for that specific request only.

For example:

Set attribute in a controller:

java
Copy code
request.setAttribute("greeting", "Hello, Venkatesh!");
This line stores the value "Hello, Venkatesh!" in the request with the name greeting.

Get attribute in a view (e.g., JSP):

java
Copy code
String message = (String) request.getAttribute("greeting");
This retrieves the greeting attribute from the request, so message will hold "Hello, Venkatesh!".

This is helpful when you want to share data for the duration of a single HTTP request, such as passing data from the controller to the view to be displayed to the user.

 
-----------------------------------------------

In Spring MVC, @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URL and pass them as parameters to a controller method.

Imagine you have a URL like this:

bash
Copy code
/user/123
In this case, 123 could be an ID for a user. You can set up a controller method to capture that value directly from the URL using @PathVariable.

Here's how it works:

Define a URL pattern with a placeholder in your controller:

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUserById(@PathVariable("id") int userId) {
    // Now, userId will have the value 123 when the URL is /user/123
    // Do something with userId, like fetching user data from a database
    return "userProfile";
}
In the URL /user/123, Spring will automatically match 123 to {id} and assign it to the userId parameter.

In simple terms, @PathVariable lets you take part of the URL and use it directly in your method, making it easy to handle dynamic data in URLs.

------------------------------------------------------------


What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a menu in a restaurant:

It tells you what dishes you can order (what a system can do).
You don't need to know how the food is prepared (how the system works internally).
You just order from the menu, and the restaurant (system) does the work for you.
In the tech world, an API allows two systems to communicate with each other and exchange data.

What is a REST API?
REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a specific type of API that
follows some rules (principles) to allow communication between a client (e.g., your browser) and a server (e.g., a website's backend).

It uses standard HTTP methods like:

GET: To get (retrieve) data.
POST: To create new data.
PUT: To update existing data.
DELETE: To delete data.
