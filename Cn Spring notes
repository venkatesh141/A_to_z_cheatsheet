Here's a simple comparison of Spring and Spring Boot:

Spring Framework:
Core Framework:

It's a comprehensive framework for building Java applications.
Provides tools for dependency injection, AOP, data access, transaction management, and more.
Configuration:

Requires a lot of manual configuration using XML or annotations.
Developers need to set up application servers and libraries.
Flexibility:

Offers great flexibility but requires more effort to integrate tools like Hibernate, JMS, etc.
No Embedded Server:

Does not come with an embedded server; you need to deploy the application on servers like Tomcat or Jetty.
Spring Boot:
Built on Spring:

It's a layer on top of the Spring framework, making it easier to use.
Auto-Configuration:

Provides auto-configuration to reduce manual setup.
Helps developers skip boilerplate configuration.
Embedded Server:

Comes with an embedded Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow server, allowing you to run applications without an external server.
Opinionated Defaults:

Provides sensible defaults for common configurations, but you can customize them if needed.
Ready-to-Use Starter Dependencies:

Offers "starter" packages like spring-boot-starter-web to include dependencies for web applications.
Spring Boot CLI:

Allows quick application creation with Groovy scripts.
When to Use?
Use Spring if you need more control and customization for complex applications.
Use Spring Boot for rapid application development, especially for microservices or simple applications, as it simplifies and speeds up the development process.
Let me know if you'd like examples or deeper explanations!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Spring Boot, the web dependency is a feature that helps you build web applications, such as websites or REST APIs.

When you add the Spring Web dependency to your project, it provides you with tools to:

Handle HTTP requests and responses: For example, you can create a REST API that responds to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests.
Use MVC architecture: It helps you organize your code into controllers (to handle requests), services (to process logic), and models (to represent data).
Embed a web server: Spring Boot includes an embedded server (like Tomcat) so your application can run immediately without needing extra setup.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Annotations
@Component
When you add @Component to a class, Spring will:

Create an object (or bean) of that class for you.
Manage it, so you don't have to manually create or destroy the object.
It simplifies your code by letting Spring handle object creation and management. 
This is super useful in larger projects where managing objects yourself can become messy.
------
@Autowired

In Spring Framework, @Autowired is an annotation that tells Spring:

"Hey, find the required bean (object) and automatically inject it into this class where I need it."
It helps you avoid manually creating or passing objects. Spring will connect or wire the dependent objects for you.
------
@Qualifier
In Spring, @Qualifier works with @Autowired to solve a specific problem:

What if there are multiple beans of the same type?
@Qualifier tells Spring which specific bean to inject when there’s more than one option.

   @Component
public class PaidCourse implements Course {
	String courseName;
	@Autowired
	@Qualifier("javaInstructor")
	Instructor courseInstructor;
	@Autowired
	UserList userList;
// additional methods
}
Confusion happens when:
Multiple beans have the same type (directly or via a parent class/interface).
Spring needs a way to know which bean to inject.
Use @Qualifier to tell Spring the exact bean name

------
@Scope
Singleton (Default):

One object shared across the entire application.
Example: A shared service used by all parts of the app.
Prototype:

Creates a new object every time the bean is requested.
Example: When you need a separate instance for each user request.

------
@PostConstruct
In Spring, @PostConstruct is an annotation used to mark a method that should run immediately after the bean is created and dependency injection is done. It's like saying:

"After you set everything up for this bean, run this method."
Why Use @PostConstruct?
It’s typically used for:

Initialization tasks (like setting up resources or validating configurations).
Running code once after the bean is ready.

------
@Predestroy

In Spring, @PreDestroy is an annotation used to mark a method that should run just before the bean is destroyed. It’s like saying:

"Before this bean is removed, clean up resources or perform some final tasks."
Why Use @PreDestroy?
It’s typically used for:

Releasing resources (e.g., closing database connections, stopping threads).
Performing cleanup tasks before the bean is destroyed.


------
@SpringBootApplication  // need to learn about this later

What is @SpringBootApplication?
@SpringBootApplication is a key annotation in Spring Boot. It combines three annotations:

@EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism.
Enables auto-configuration (e.g., setting up an embedded server like Tomcat).
@ComponentScan: Automatically scans the package for components, services, and configurations.
@Configuration: Indicates that the class is a configuration class where beans can be defined.
This annotation tells Spring Boot to start your application, configure everything automatically, and look for components in your code.

------
@Service


What is @Service in Spring?
@Service is an annotation in Spring used to indicate that a class provides business logic (service layer functionality).
It helps in organizing the application into logical layers like controllers, services, and repositories.

Key Features:
Specialized Component: It is a specialization of @Component. Spring detects it during component scanning and registers it as a bean.
Business Logic: Typically used to write the core business logic of the application.
Dependency Injection: Makes it easier to inject the service into other layers like controllers.

Separates business logic from other layers like the controller or repository.
Promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

So, @Service bridges the controller (user interaction) and repository (data handling) layers by processing the business logic in between.
------
@Controller
@Controller is a Spring annotation that is used to define a controller in a web application. It is part of the presentation layer 
and is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them (with help from services), and returning a view (like HTML, JSP, or Thymeleaf) as a response.

Key Features of @Controller:
Handles Requests:

Maps HTTP requests (like GET, POST) to specific methods using annotations like @GetMapping or @PostMapping.
Returns a View:

Used for applications where the response is a view (e.g., JSP, Thymeleaf).
It returns the name of the view to be rendered.
Part of MVC:

Works as the Controller in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

------
@Repository

What is @Repository in Spring?
@Repository is an annotation in Spring used to indicate that a class is a Data Access Object (DAO). 
These classes are responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

It is part of the persistence layer in an application and is used in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

Key Features of @Repository:
Database Interaction:
Used to fetch, save, update, or delete data in the database.
Specialized @Component:
It is a specialization of @Component. Spring automatically detects it and registers it as a bean.
Exception Translation:
Converts database-specific exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException.
------
@Bean

What is @Bean in Spring?
@Bean is an annotation in Spring used to define and manage Spring beans (objects). 
It tells the Spring container to instantiate, configure, and manage a method's return value as a bean.

It is usually used in a @Configuration class to create custom beans for the application.
------
@RequestMapping

What is @RequestMapping in Spring?
@RequestMapping is an annotation in Spring used to map HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific methods in a controller class. 
It tells the controller which URL the user is trying to access and what method to execute.
It can be applied at the class level (to map a base URL) or method level (to map specific endpoints).

------
Model View Controller
What is MVC?
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a design pattern used to organize code in a way that separates the logic, 
user interface, and user input into three different components. This helps to keep the code clean and organized.

MVC Breakdown:
Model:

What it does: Represents the data or business logic of your application.
Example: A Product class that stores product details like name, price, and description.
View:

What it does: Handles the display or the UI (User Interface). It shows data to the user.
Example: A webpage or a screen showing a list of products.
Controller:

What it does: Acts as a middleman between the Model and the View. It handles the user input (like button clicks or URL requests) and updates the Model or View accordingly.
Example: A method that receives a request like "show all products," gets the product data from the Model, and sends it to the View to display.
How MVC Works Together:
User Interaction:

The user makes a request (like clicking a button or entering a URL).
Controller:

The Controller handles that request and asks the Model for data.
Model:

The Model fetches the necessary data (like from a database) and returns it.
View:

The Controller sends the data to the View, and the View displays it to the user.
----------------------------------------------
JSP stands for JavaServer Pages. 
It is a technology used to create dynamic web pages in Java. 
JSP allows you to embed Java code directly into HTML pages to generate dynamic content based on user requests.

Why Use JSP?
Dynamic Content: Allows you to create web pages that can change based on user interaction or server-side data.
Java Integration: Easy integration with Java classes and libraries for tasks like database access.
Separation of Concerns: JSP allows you to separate the presentation (HTML) from the logic (Java), though this is usually improved further by frameworks like Spring MVC.

JSP vs. HTML:
HTML is static, meaning it cannot change based on user interaction or data without other tools (like JavaScript).
JSP can generate dynamic content by mixing Java code with HTML, enabling you to display different content based on conditions or user input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MVC only

package com.example.website.web;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller//it can handle http request and returns responses  typically html or jsp
//defines this class as a Spring MVC controller.
public class HomeController {
 @RequestMapping("/home")
 public String getHomePage() {
     return "home";
 }
}


@RequestMapping("/home"): This annotation maps the URL /home to the getHomePage method.
 When a user visits http://yourdomain.com/home, this method will handle the request.
public String getHomePage() { ... }: This method returns a String, which represents the name of the view to render.
return "home";: This line returns the view name "home". Spring looks for a view file (like home.html or home.jsp) 
in the configured view folder, renders it, and sends it as the response.



@RequestMapping("/signUp")
public String getSignUpPage(Model uiModel) {  //Model holds data that can be passed to the view
    User user = userService.getUser();
    uiModel.addAttribute("user", user);
    return "signup";
}

model
In the context of Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications, 
the model is the part that holds the data and represents the business logic of the application.
 It's a way to organize and store data that is shared between the controller and the view.
 
When you add data to the model in a controller, 
it becomes available to the view (like a JSP or Thymeleaf template), which then uses that data to render the final webpage.



-----------------------------------------------
@RequestMapping("/registerUser")
public String createdUser(@ModelAttribute(value = "user") StudentUser studentUser) {
    int userId = userService.signUp(studentUser.getName(), studentUser.getGender(), studentUser.getLocation(), studentUser.getCollege());
    if(userId != -1) {
        ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("redirect:welcome?id=" + userId);
        return modelAndView.getViewName();
    }
    return "signup";
}



When we use @ModelAttribute, we’re telling Spring to "connect" or "link" data from a form 
(like the values someone enters on a webpage) to a Java object. This way, we don’t have to manually pick each value
 from the form; Spring does it for us automatically.

-----------------------------------------------
 
 What is ModelAndView?
Think of ModelAndView as a "package" that contains:

The webpage you want to show.
The data you want to send to that webpa
Example:
Imagine you are sending a birthday greeting:

You need to tell your friend which greeting card to open (this is the "webpage").
You also need to tell your friend what to write on the card (this is the "data").
ModelAndView helps you do both things at the same time


"redirect:welcome?id=" + userId:

redirect:: This tells Spring to redirect the user to a new URL instead of just rendering a page. This is like telling the browser, "Go to this new page."
"welcome?id=" + userId: After the redirect:, we define the new page to go to, which in this case is the "welcome" page.
?id=" + userId: We are adding a query parameter id to the URL. This will pass the value of userId to the welcome page.
For example, if userId = 123, the new URL will be /welcome?id=123.

-----------------------------------------------

What is ModelMap?
ModelMap is a container used to hold data that you want to send from your controller 
to the view (webpage). It allows you to add key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the data and the value is 
the actual data itself. You can think of it as a box where you place data that will later be used in the view.
 
 
 map.addAttribute("userId", userID);:

This adds the userID to the ModelMap with the name "userId".
This means the data (userID, like "123") will be available in the view and can be accessed by the name "userId".
 
 
----------------------------------------------- 
 What is @RequestParam?
@RequestParam is an annotation used in Spring MVC to get data that is passed 
from the URL or form to the controller method. It helps you retrieve query parameters from the URL or form input fields.

Simple Example:
Imagine you have a URL like this:

http://example.com/welcome?id=123
In this URL, id=123 is the query parameter. @RequestParam can help you get the value of this parameter (in this case, 123) in your controller method.

Code Example:
java
Copy code
@RequestMapping("/welcome")
public String ShowWelcomePage(@RequestParam("id") String userID) {
    // userID will be 123 from the URL http://example.com/welcome?id=123
    return "welcome";
}
----------------------------------------------- 

Difference between ModelAttribute and RequestParam

Purpose
@RequestParam:

Used to retrieve individual query parameters or form data by name from the URL or request.
Ideal for simple data types like strings, integers, etc.
@ModelAttribute:

Used to bind an entire model object with data from the form or request.
Suitable for complex objects (like a User or Order object) where you have multiple fields (name, age, location, etc.).
Automatically maps the request data to the fields of the object


-----------------------------------------------

ChatGPT
In Spring MVC, request.getAttribute() is used to retrieve data stored in the request scope. When you use request.setAttribute("name", value),
you’re adding data to the request so that you can pass information from one part of your code (e.g., a controller) to another (e.g., a view like JSP) for that specific request only.

For example:

Set attribute in a controller:

java
Copy code
request.setAttribute("greeting", "Hello, Venkatesh!");
This line stores the value "Hello, Venkatesh!" in the request with the name greeting.

Get attribute in a view (e.g., JSP):

java
Copy code
String message = (String) request.getAttribute("greeting");
This retrieves the greeting attribute from the request, so message will hold "Hello, Venkatesh!".

This is helpful when you want to share data for the duration of a single HTTP request, such as passing data from the controller to the view to be displayed to the user.

 
-----------------------------------------------

In Spring MVC, @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URL and pass them as parameters to a controller method.

Imagine you have a URL like this:

bash
Copy code
/user/123
In this case, 123 could be an ID for a user. You can set up a controller method to capture that value directly from the URL using @PathVariable.

Here's how it works:

Define a URL pattern with a placeholder in your controller:

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUserById(@PathVariable("id") int userId) {
    // Now, userId will have the value 123 when the URL is /user/123
    // Do something with userId, like fetching user data from a database
    return "userProfile";
}
In the URL /user/123, Spring will automatically match 123 to {id} and assign it to the userId parameter.

In simple terms, @PathVariable lets you take part of the URL and use it directly in your method, making it easy to handle dynamic data in URLs.

------------------------------------------------------------


What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a menu in a restaurant:

It tells you what dishes you can order (what a system can do).
You don't need to know how the food is prepared (how the system works internally).
You just order from the menu, and the restaurant (system) does the work for you.
In the tech world, an API allows two systems to communicate with each other and exchange data.

What is a REST API?
REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a specific type of API that
follows some rules (principles) to allow communication between a client (e.g., your browser) and a server (e.g., a website's backend).

It uses standard HTTP methods like:

GET: To get (retrieve) data.
POST: To create new data.
PUT: To update existing data.
DELETE: To delete data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

In Spring MVC, @PathVariable is used to extract values from the URL and pass them as parameters to a controller method.

Imagine you have a URL like this:

bash
Copy code
/user/123
In this case, 123 could be an ID for a user. You can set up a controller method to capture that value directly from the URL using @PathVariable.

Here's how it works:

Define a URL pattern with a placeholder in your controller:

java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUserById(@PathVariable("id") int userId) {
    // Now, userId will have the value 123 when the URL is /user/123
    // Do something with userId, like fetching user data from a database
    return "userProfile";
}
In the URL /user/123, Spring will automatically match 123 to {id} and assign it to the userId parameter.

In simple terms, @PathVariable lets you take part of the URL and use it directly in your method, making it easy to handle dynamic data in URLs.

------------------------------------------------------------
Class-Level Annotation
@RestController

    Purpose: Tells Spring Boot that this class handles HTTP requests and sends back responses (usually as text or JSON).
    Effect: Every method in this class will return data as the response body, not a view (like in a website).
RestController is used for making restful web services with the help of the @RestController annotation. This annotation is used at the class level and allows the class to handle the requests made by the client. 


@RequestMapping("/project")

    Purpose: Sets a base URL for all endpoints in this class.
    Effect: All methods in this class will have URLs starting with /project.
    
Method-Level Annotations

    @RequestMapping("/hello")
        Purpose: Maps the URL /project/hello to this method.
        Effect: When someone visits /project/hello, the method runs and returns "Hello Coding Ninjas !"
        
 @GetMapping("/hello-world")

    Purpose: Maps the URL /project/hello-world to this method for HTTP GET requests only.
    Effect: When a GET request is sent to /project/hello-world, the method runs and returns "Hello from Earth !".
    Difference from @RequestMapping: @GetMapping is specific to GET requests, while @RequestMapping can handle multiple types (GET, POST, etc.).

       
        
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 What is @PathVariable?

@PathVariable is an annotation in Spring Boot used to capture values from the URL and pass them into your method as variables.
--------------------------------------------------------

@PostMapping is an annotation in Spring Boot used to map HTTP POST requests to a specific method in your controller class.

Simple Explanation:
When a client (like a browser or app) sends a POST request to your server, @PostMapping helps the server handle that request.
It is typically used when the client wants to send data (like a form or JSON) to the server, usually to create or save something.


@PostMapping("/addUser"): Handles POST requests sent to the "/addUser" endpoint.
@RequestBody User user: Captures the data sent by the client (e.g., JSON) and converts it into a User object.
Response: Returns a message after processing.
Use @PostMapping whenever you need to send data to your server for operations like adding a record, submitting a form, or uploading something.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
@DeleteMapping
In Spring Boot, @DeleteMapping is an annotation used in RESTful APIs to
handle HTTP DELETE requests. It is typically used to delete a resource (like a record in a database).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@PutMapping
In Spring Boot, @PutMapping is an annotation used in a REST API to handle HTTP PUT requests. It is generally used to update an existing resource.

Here’s a simple way to understand it:

    PUT is like editing or updating something. For example, if you already have a profile with your name and you want to update it with a new name, a PUT request is sent.
    @PutMapping maps this PUT request to a specific method in your controller so that it can handle the update logic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ResponseStatus is an annotation in Spring Boot that is used to tell the application to return a specific HTTP status code when a method or exception is invoked.

Simple Explanation:
Imagine your application is responding to a user. Instead of just saying "Something went wrong", you want to send more specific information like:

"Not Found" (404)
"Bad Request" (400)
"Internal Server Error" (500)
The @ResponseStatus annotation helps you do this easily and clearly by linking a particular exception or method to a specific status code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ObjectUtils.isEmpty() is a utility method provided by Spring Framework to check whether an object is empty or null. 
It is commonly used to avoid writing repetitive null and empty checks in your code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Spring Boot, @Size, @Min, and @Max are used for validation to ensure that input data meets certain criteria:

@Size: Ensures the size (length) of a string, collection, or array is within a specified range.
Example: @Size(min = 3, max = 10) → Input length must be between 3 and 10.

@Min: Ensures a number is not smaller than the specified minimum value.
Example: @Min(18) → Input value must be at least 18.

@Max: Ensures a number is not larger than the specified maximum value.
Example: @Max(100) → Input value must not exceed 100.

These annotations work with Spring Boot's Bean Validation framework (Hibernate Validator by default). They are applied to class fields in DTOs or models.

@Valid in Spring Boot is slightly different—it is used to trigger the validation process.

When you annotate a method parameter or field with @Valid, Spring Boot checks if the constraints (like @Size, @Min, @Max) on the object or its fields are satisfied. If the validation fails, an error is thrown.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BindingResult
Validation is applied to the model object (e.g., using @Valid or @Validated).
Any errors during validation are captured in the BindingResult object.
You can check the BindingResult for validation errors and take appropriate actions, such as displaying error messages or returning specific responses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
REST template

In Spring, the RestTemplate is a class that makes it easy to communicate with other web services (like APIs). You can think of it as a helper that lets your Java program send HTTP requests and get responses. It is part of Spring's web module.

What can it do?
Send HTTP Requests: You can send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Get Responses: It lets you fetch data from APIs or send data to them.
Example:
Imagine you're building an app, and you want to get weather data from a public API. RestTemplate helps you send the request to the API and handle the response.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP method
An HTTP method is a way for your computer to tell a web server what kind of action it wants to perform.
Think of it as a specific type of "request" when your app or browser talks to a website or API.

Common HTTP Methods:
GET:

Purpose: To fetch (read) data from the server.
Example: Viewing a website or reading data from an API.
Analogy: Like asking for information (e.g., "Show me the weather details").
POST:

Purpose: To send (create) data to the server.
Example: Submitting a form or adding a new user to a database.
Analogy: Like filling out a form and submitting it (e.g., "Add this new user").
PUT:

Purpose: To update or replace existing data on the server.
Example: Changing your profile picture.
Analogy: Like replacing an old file with a new one (e.g., "Update this user’s information").
DELETE:

Purpose: To delete data from the server.
Example: Removing your account.
Analogy: Like throwing something away (e.g., "Delete this file").
PATCH:

Purpose: To partially update data (only a part of the data is changed).
Example: Updating just your email in a user profile.
Analogy: Like correcting a single word in a document without rewriting the whole thing.
Summary:
HTTP methods are instructions you give to a server:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In simple terms, private final RestTemplate restTemplate is creating an object of the RestTemplate class,
which is commonly used in Spring Boot applications to make HTTP requests to external APIs or web services.
Imagine your application needs to get data from another website or API. The RestTemplate helps you do that with just a few lines of code:

restTemplateBuilder:
This is an instance of the RestTemplateBuilder class, which is provided by Spring Boot. It is a helper class that makes it easy to configure and create a RestTemplate object.
For example, you can use RestTemplateBuilder to add default configurations like timeouts, authentication details, interceptors, etc.

.build():
This method of RestTemplateBuilder actually creates a fully configured RestTemplate object. It takes into account any custom settings or configurations added to the builder.

URL Construction

String url = "http://localhost:8080/rating/id";

    This is the base URL where the server is running (on localhost at port 8080).
    "http://localhost:8080/rating/id" is the API endpoint, but it’s incomplete because you need to add the specific id you want to fetch the rating for.

For example:
If id = "123", the final URL will be:
http://localhost:8080/rating/id123


This code defines a method getRating(String id) that fetches a rating from a server (API) using the RestTemplate and returns it. Let’s break it into simple steps:
1. Method Signature

public long getRating(String id)

    This is a method that takes a String called id as input (e.g., a user ID or product ID).
    It returns a long value, which represents the rating.

2. URL Construction

String url = "http://localhost:8080/rating/id";

    This is the base URL where the server is running (on localhost at port 8080).
    "http://localhost:8080/rating/id" is the API endpoint, but it’s incomplete because you need to add the specific id you want to fetch the rating for.

For example:
If id = "123", the final URL will be:
http://localhost:8080/rating/id123
3. Making the API Call

ResponseEntity<Long> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(url + id, Long.class);

    restTemplate.getForEntity() is making an HTTP GET request to the server.
    url + id: Combines the base URL and the id to form the full URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/rating/id123).
    Long.class: This tells the method to expect the server's response to be a number (of type Long).

The response from the server is stored in a ResponseEntity<Long> object.
ResponseEntity is like a wrapper that contains:

    The actual data (in this case, the rating as a Long).
    Metadata (like HTTP status code).

4. Extracting the Data

return response.getBody();

    response.getBody() extracts the actual rating value from the ResponseEntity.
    This value is then returned as the output of the method.

------------------------------------------------

@Autowired
public RatingServiceCommunicator(RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder) {
    this.restTemplate = restTemplateBuilder.build();
}


The @Autowired annotation ensures that the RestTemplateBuilder (managed by Spring) is automatically injected into the constructor.
This injected builder is then used to create a RestTemplate object, which can be used for making HTTP requests.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Long ratingResponse = restTemplate.getForObject(url + id, Long.class);
Explanation:
RestTemplate:
This is a class in Spring used to make HTTP requests to other web services or APIs. Think of it as a tool to communicate with another server.

getForObject():
This method is used to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and expects to receive a response from the server. 
The response is then automatically converted into the type you specify (in this case, Long).

url + id:
The url is the base URL of the web service you are calling. By adding id to it, you are creating the full URL to fetch specific data for that id. For example:

java
Copy code
url = "http://example.com/api/ratings/";
id = 123;
// Full URL becomes: "http://example.com/api/ratings/123"
Long.class:
This tells RestTemplate that the response from the server should be converted into a Long data type. For example, if the server returns the number 100, it will be stored as a Long.

ratingResponse:
This is the variable where the server's response (a Long value) will be stored.

In Simple Words:
You're sending a GET request to a server at url + id.
The server responds with a number (e.g., 100), which is automatically converted into a Long.
This number is then stored in the variable ratingResponse.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
restTemplate.postForObject(url, ratingMap, Object.class);


url: This is the endpoint (API or web service) where the data will be sent.
ratingMap: This is the actual data you want to send in the POST request. It’s usually a Map or an object with the information you want to send.
Object.class: This tells the method what type of response to expect from the server. In this case, it expects any generic Object.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HttpEntity requestEntity = new HttpEntity(ratingMap);
restTemplate.exchange(url, HttpMethod.POST, requestEntity, Object.class);

Explanation:
HttpEntity requestEntity = new HttpEntity(ratingMap);:

HttpEntity: This is a container that holds:
The body of your request (in this case, ratingMap).
Optional headers (like content type, authentication, etc.).
Here, you are wrapping the ratingMap (your data) inside an HttpEntity to prepare it for sending as part of the request.
restTemplate.exchange(...):

This is a flexible method to send any type of HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and handle the response.
Parameters:

url: The endpoint (API or web service) where you are sending the request.
HttpMethod.POST: Specifies the HTTP method as POST. You’re sending data to the server.
requestEntity: The HttpEntity you created earlier, which contains the data (ratingMap) and optionally headers.
Object.class: Indicates the type of response you expect back from the server. Here, it’s a generic Object.
What it does:

It sends the ratingMap as the body of a POST request to the specified url.
It receives the server’s response, which is converted to an Object (or whatever type you specify instead of Object.class).
Example in simple steps:
Think of it like preparing a package (your ratingMap data) for delivery.
You pack the data into a box (HttpEntity).
Then, you send it to the destination (url) using the POST method (HttpMethod.POST).
Once delivered, you wait for the response (e.g., "Package received!"), which you handle as a generic object (Object.class).
