1. Eureka Server

Think of Eureka Server as a phone directory for your microservices.

In microservices, we have many small services (like User-Service, Order-Service, Payment-Service). They keep starting and stopping, and their addresses (IP/Port) might change.

Instead of remembering their exact addresses, each service registers itself with Eureka.

So, if User-Service wants to talk to Order-Service, it just asks Eureka:
👉 “Hey, where is Order-Service right now?”

Eureka replies with the correct location.

🔹 In short:
Eureka = Service Registry = Keeps track of all running services.

2. API Gateway

Imagine you have many services (User-Service, Product-Service, Cart-Service).

Without a gateway, the client (like frontend React app) has to call each service separately.
Example:

/user/getUser/1

/product/getProduct/10

/cart/getCart/5

This becomes messy 😵.

API Gateway acts like a single entry point.

The client calls only the gateway (like /api/user/1),

The gateway forwards the request to the correct service.

🔹 Extra features of Gateway:

Authentication (check if user is logged in).

Logging.

Rate limiting (control traffic).

Route requests smartly.

👉 In Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Gateway is commonly used.

3. Load Balancer

Suppose we have multiple instances of the same service (say 3 copies of User-Service) to handle more traffic.

Who decides which instance should handle the next request? 🤔

That’s the Load Balancer’s job.

Example:

Request 1 → goes to User-Service-1

Request 2 → goes to User-Service-2

Request 3 → goes to User-Service-3

It keeps traffic balanced so that no single service is overloaded.

👉 In Spring Boot microservices, Ribbon (old) or Spring Cloud LoadBalancer (new) is used.

Putting It All Together 🚀

Eureka Server → Keeps addresses of all services.

API Gateway → Acts as one entry point, routes request to correct service.

Load Balancer → Distributes requests evenly among multiple instances of a service.

👉 Flow Example:
Frontend → API Gateway → asks Eureka where the service is → Gateway forwards request → Load Balancer spreads load across service instances → Service responds.

Do you want me to draw a diagram flow (step-by-step arrows) so you can see how these three work together?
