What is Git?
Git is a tool.

It helps you track changes in your code (or any files).

It‚Äôs like a time machine for your code. You can go back and see how your code looked yesterday or last week.

You can also work with others and easily combine everyone's changes.

‚û°Ô∏è Think of Git like a "Save with History" button for your project.
