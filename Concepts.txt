    abstract void makeSound();

    
    void sleep() {

class Dog extends Animal {
    // The body of makeSound() is provided here

public class AbstractionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create objects of Dog and Cat
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();
        
        // Call the makeSound() method on both objects
        myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof Woof
        myCat.makeSound(); // Outputs: Meow Meow
        
        // Call the sleep() method on both objects
        myDog.sleep(); // Outputs: This animal is sleeping.
        myCat.sleep(); // Outputs: This animal is sleeping.
    }
}
Abstract classes set up a common structure (like requiring makeSound() for all animals).
They allow each subclass (like Dog or Cat) to have its own behavior while still following the same basic rules.

Payment System: In a payment processing system, you may have an abstract class Payment with an abstract method processPayment(). Different payment types like CreditCardPayment, PaypalPayment, and UPIPayment would extend the Payment class and provide their own implementations of processPayment().

Thread 

Real Time Use of Stack
 Web Browser
When you open a webpage, a browser uses one thread to load the page text and another thread to load images and videos. 
This way, the page doesn’t freeze while everything loads—each part loads at the same time.

In a chat app like WhatsApp:
One thread is used to display incoming messages in real-time.
Another thread is used to send messages and deliver notifications

Two methods to implement thread
one is using thread
public class Main extends Thread {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main thread = new Main();
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}

another way is using Runnable
public class Main implements Runnable {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main obj = new Main();
    Thread thread = new Thread(obj);
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }

Inheritance In Java

Java, Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). 
It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. 

Single Inheritance

import java.io.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.*;

// Parent class
class One {
    public void print_geek()
    {
        System.out.println("Geeks");
    }
}

class Two extends One {
    public void print_for() { System.out.println("for"); }
}

// Driver class
public class Main {
      // Main function
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Two g = new Two();
        g.print_geek();
        g.print_for();
        g.print_geek();
    }
}

Multilevel Inheritance

class One {
    // Method to print "Geeks"
    public void print_geek() {
        System.out.println("Geeks");
    }
}

// Child class Two inherits from class One
class Two extends One {
    // Method to print "for"
    public void print_for() {
        System.out.println("for");
    }
}

// Child class Three inherits from class Two
class Three extends Two {
    // Method to print "Geeks"
    public void print_lastgeek() {
        System.out.println("Geeks");
    }
}

// Driver class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of class Three
        Three g = new Three();
        
        // Calling method from class One
        g.print_geek();
        
        // Calling method from class Two
        g.print_for();
        
        // Calling method from class Three
        g.print_lastgeek();
    }
}



Hierarchical Inheritance

class A {
    public void print_A() 
    { 
    System.out.println("Class A"); 
    }
}

class B extends A {
    public void print_B() 
    {
     System.out.println("Class B"); 
    }
}

class C extends A {
    public void print_C() { 
    System.out.println("Class C");
     }
}

class D extends A {
    public void print_D() {
     System.out.println("Class D");
      }
}

// Driver Class
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        B obj_B = new B();
        obj_B.print_A();
        obj_B.print_B();

        C obj_C = new C();
        obj_C.print_A();
        obj_C.print_C();

        D obj_D = new D();
        obj_D.print_A();
        obj_D.print_D();
    }
}

Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces)

interface One {
    public void print_geek();
}

interface Two {
    public void print_for();
}

interface Three extends One, Two {
    public void print_geek();
}
class Child implements Three {
    @Override public void print_geek()
    {
        System.out.println("Geeks");
    }

    public void print_for() { System.out.println("for"); }
}

// Drived class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Child c = new Child();
        c.print_geek();
        c.print_for();
        c.print_geek();
    }
}


Hybrid Inheritance


// Base class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

// First interface
interface Pet {
    void beFriendly();
}

// Second interface
interface Wild {
    void hunt();
}

// Derived class using hybrid inheritance
class Dog extends Animal implements Pet, Wild {
    public void beFriendly() {
        System.out.println("Dog is being friendly");
    }    
    public void hunt() {
        System.out.println("Dog is hunting");
    }
    
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        
        // Calling methods from different parts of the inheritance structure
        dog.eat();          // Inherited from Animal class
        dog.bark();         // Defined in Dog class
        dog.beFriendly();   // Implemented from Pet interface
        dog.hunt();         // Implemented from Wild interface
    }
}

Usage of Inheritance 

class Account {
    double balance;

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println("Deposited: " + amount);
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: " + amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance");
        }
    }
}

class SavingsAccount extends Account {
    double interestRate = 0.03;

    public void applyInterest() {
        balance += balance * interestRate;
        System.out.println("Interest applied at rate: " + interestRate);
    }
}

class CheckingAccount extends Account {
    double overdraftLimit = 500.0;

    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance + overdraftLimit >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Withdrew: " + amount + " with overdraft");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Overdraft limit reached");
        }
    }
}
Code Reusability: Both SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount inherit common functionality (deposit and withdraw) from Account, 
so the code doesn’t need to be duplicated.

Method Overriding and Polymorphism: CheckingAccount overrides withdraw to allow overdrafts, while SavingsAccount 
uses the default withdrawal behavior from Account.

Code Organization and Extensibility: The account hierarchy (general Account with specific SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount) 
makes it easy to add new account types in the future.

Maintaining Centralized Code: Any update to deposit or the basic withdraw logic
 in Account will propagate to all account types automatically, making maintenance easy.


Inheritannce real world applicatioin
 
 2. Banking System
Scenario: A banking application often has various types of accounts with shared features but distinct behaviors.
Inheritance Structure:
Account (Superclass): Contains common attributes like accountNumber, balance, and methods like deposit() and withdraw().
SavingsAccount (Subclass): Inherits Account and may add features like interestRate and calculateInterest().
CheckingAccount (Subclass): Inherits Account and includes features like overdraftLimit.
Benefit: Shared behaviors like deposit() and withdraw() are defined in Account, while each subclass implements 
additional features specific to the account type, making the code organized and reusable.

1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
What it is: The JVM is a virtual "engine" that runs Java applications.
What it does: It converts Java bytecode (compiled Java code) into machine code that your computer’s hardware understands, 
so it can actually run the program.
Why it’s important: The JVM allows Java programs to be "write once, run anywhere" 
because it handles converting Java code to run on any operating system, like Windows, Mac, or Linux.


2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
What it is: The JRE is a package that includes the JVM along with some additional libraries and tools needed to run Java applications.
What it does: It provides the environment required to run Java programs, 
but it doesn’t include any tools to develop Java applications.
Why it’s important: The JRE is needed if you only want to run Java applications (not develop or compile them). For instance,
 if you're downloading a Java app or game, you’d need the JRE installed on your computer.
   
   
 
3. JDK (Java Development Kit)
What it is: The JDK is a complete package that includes the JRE, JVM, and
 additional tools for developing Java applications, like the compiler (javac), debuggers, and other tools.
What it does: The JDK provides everything needed to write, compile, and run Java programs. 
It’s required if you want to create Java applications.
Why it’s important: If you’re a Java developer, you need the JDK because it allows you to write and compile Java code.



In Summary:
JVM: Runs the compiled Java code.
JRE: Runs Java applications by including the JVM and essential libraries.
JDK: Develops and runs Java applications by including the JRE, JVM, and development tools.
If you want to just run Java apps, you need the JRE. If you want to develop Java apps, you need the JDK. And 
the JVM is the engine that makes Java code runnable on any system.


Compiler (javac): Converts .java (source code) to .class (bytecode).
JVM: Executes .class files by converting bytecode to machine code, enabling the program to run on the system.

Real time use of stack,queue,ll,tree,graph

Here’s a breakdown of the real-time applications of stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs:

1. Stack
Undo Functionality: In applications like text editors, the stack stores previous states. Each action is pushed to a stack, and "Undo" pops the last action.
Web Browser Navigation: Browsers use stacks to store the history of pages you visited. Pressing "Back" pops the last page, returning to the previous one.
Expression Evaluation: Compilers and interpreters use stacks to evaluate arithmetic expressions or syntax parsing.
Recursive Function Calls: Stacks help manage function calls in programming languages, especially with recursion, where each function call is stacked on top of the last one.

2. Queue
Scheduling Processes in Operating Systems: OS schedulers use queues to manage processes and tasks waiting to be executed.
Customer Service Lines: Any system handling requests in a first-come, first-served manner uses queues, like customer support chat systems or bank teller queues.
Printers: Print jobs are placed in a queue to be processed in order.
Data Streaming (e.g., IoT, Media): Data packets are queued and processed in the order they are received, ensuring consistent streaming.

3. Linked List
Music and Video Playlists: Applications often use linked lists to allow for easy insertion and deletion of items (songs, videos) without reordering the entire structure.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Linked lists can be used to store states, allowing easy navigation back and forth through user actions.
Memory Management: In low-level memory allocation, free blocks of memory can be stored in a linked list, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
File Systems: Many file systems use linked lists to store blocks of files, especially for files that aren’t contiguous in memory.

4. Tree
File Systems: File directories are often organized as a tree structure, where folders and files are stored hierarchically.
Databases (e.g., B-Trees in indexing): Databases use tree structures for efficient data indexing and retrieval, enabling quick searches.
XML/HTML Document Object Model (DOM): The DOM represents the structure of HTML or XML documents as a tree, allowing easy traversal and manipulation.
Artificial Intelligence (e.g., Decision Trees): Decision trees are used for various AI applications, including decision-making algorithms and machine learning models.


5. Graph
Social Networks: Graphs represent relationships between users. Nodes are people, and edges are connections (friendships, follows).
Navigation Systems (Google Maps, GPS): Graphs represent locations as nodes and paths as edges, allowing algorithms to find the shortest or optimal routes.
Network Routing: Graphs model networks where routers and switches are nodes, and data connections are edges, supporting efficient routing of data packets.
Recommendation Systems: In recommendation engines, graphs model relationships between users and items (e.g., products, movies) to suggest items based on user interactions.
Each of these structures is essential for different types of applications due to their unique ways of managing data and allowing efficient data access, manipulation, and traversal.

Polymorphism is a core concept in Java that allows methods or objects to take on multiple forms.
It is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming and provides flexibility in designing and using code.
In Java, polymorphism is mainly implemented in two ways:

Compile-time (or Static) Polymorphism: Achieved via method overloading.
Runtime (or Dynamic) Polymorphism: Achieved via method overriding.
Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
What it is: Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists (different number or types of parameters).
Use: Allows a class to perform similar operations in different ways depending on the input parameters.
Example:
java
Copy code
public class MathOperations {
    // Overloaded methods
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
        System.out.println(math.add(5, 10));        // Calls int add(int, int)
        System.out.println(math.add(5.5, 10.5));    // Calls double add(double, double)
        System.out.println(math.add(5, 10, 15));    // Calls int add(int, int, int)
    }
}
2. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
What it is: When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass. 
The overridden method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as in the superclass.
Use: Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, enabling polymorphic behavior.
Example:
java
Copy code
class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myAnimal.sound();  // Outputs: Animal makes a sound
        myDog.sound();     // Outputs: Dog barks
        myCat.sound();     // Outputs: Cat meows
    }
}
Advantages of Using Polymorphism
Code Flexibility: You can handle different types of objects in a uniform way. For example,
 if you have an array of Animal types, you can fill it with Dog, Cat, etc., and call sound() on each element without needing to know its specific subclass.
Easier to Scale: If a new subclass is added (e.g., Bird), you don’t have to change the code that uses Animal references—just add the new subclass.
Enhances Extensibility: Polymorphism enables you to add new functionality with minimal changes, making the code more extensible.

Polymorphism in Real-World Applications

Collections Framework: Java’s collection framework relies heavily on polymorphism.
 For example, you can use a List interface reference to hold an ArrayList or LinkedList object and interact with them through the same set of List methods.

Usage of static 


3. Singleton Pattern

In the Singleton design pattern, a single instance of a class is used across the application. A static method is typically used to provide a global point of access to this instance.

public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static DatabaseConnection instance;

    private DatabaseConnection() { }

    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new DatabaseConnection();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

// Usage
DatabaseConnection dbConnection = DatabaseConnection.getInstance();

Here, getInstance() is a static method that provides a single instance of DatabaseConnection across the application. This is often used for classes like DatabaseConnection where only one instance should exist.

 
 1. Utility Classes (Helper Functions)

Utility classes often use static methods since they perform general operations that don't rely on instance-specific data. For example, Math in Java is a utility class with static methods for common mathematical calculations.

public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static double calculateCircleArea(double radius) {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

// Usage
int sum = MathUtils.add(10, 5);
double area = MathUtils.calculateCircleArea(3.5);

Here, the add and calculateCircleArea methods are static because they do not depend on object-specific data. These can be called directly without creating an instance of MathUtils.

Real-Time Usage of Class and Object

    Bank Account System:
        Class: BankAccount
        Attributes: accountNumber, balance
        Methods: deposit(), withdraw()
        Object: Each user's bank account is an object created from the BankAccount class.

    Library Management:
        Class: Book
        Attributes: title, author, ISBN
        Methods: borrowBook(), returnBook()
        Object: Each book in the library is an object of the Book class.

    E-Commerce System:
        Class: Product
        Attributes: name, price, quantity
        Methods: addToCart(), applyDiscount()
        Object: Each product in the store is an object.
