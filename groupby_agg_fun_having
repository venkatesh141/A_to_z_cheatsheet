In SQL, GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions are used to summarize and filter grouped data. Let’s go through each one in detail.
 GROUP BY

The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.

 Example:

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

👉 This groups employees by department and calculates the total salary for each department.
2️⃣ Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include:
Function	Description
SUM()	Returns the sum of a column.
AVG()	Returns the average value.
COUNT()	Returns the number of rows.
MAX()	Returns the maximum value.
MIN()	Returns the minimum value.

 Example:

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

 This counts employees and calculates the average salary for each department.
 HAVING

The HAVING clause is used to filter groups after aggregation (like WHERE, but for grouped data).

 Example:

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;

 This filters out departments where the total salary is ≤ 50,000.
 Difference between WHERE and HAVING
Feature	WHERE	HAVING
Works on	Individual rows	Grouped data
Used with	SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE	GROUP BY
Can filter	Before aggregation	After aggregation

 Example:

-- Filter employees before grouping
SELECT department, SUM(salary) 
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 3000
GROUP BY department;

-- Filter departments after aggregation
SELECT department, SUM(salary) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;

 Summary

✔ GROUP BY → Groups rows based on a column.
✔ Aggregate functions → Used to summarize data (SUM(), AVG(), etc.).
✔ HAVING → Filters grouped data after aggregation.
✔ Use WHERE to filter individual rows before grouping.

Here are three examples each for GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions using a sample employees table.
🔹 Sample Table: employees
id	name	department	salary	age	city
1	John	IT	60000	30	New York
2	Alice	IT	70000	28	Chicago
3	Bob	HR	50000	35	New York
4	Eve	HR	55000	40	Chicago
5	Tom	Sales	45000	32	New York
6	Rick	Sales	48000	29	Los Angeles
7	Leo	IT	72000	27	Chicago
✅ 1. GROUP BY Examples
📌 Example 1: Grouping by Department

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

👉 Counts the number of employees in each department.
📌 Example 2: Total Salary by City

SELECT city, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY city;

👉 Calculates the total salary paid to employees in each city.
📌 Example 3: Average Salary by Department

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

👉 Finds the average salary for each department.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ 2. Aggregate Function Examples (SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), etc.)
📌 Example 1: Total Salary of All Employees

SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;

👉 Calculates the total salary paid to all employees.
📌 Example 2: Highest and Lowest Salaries

SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary, MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary FROM employees;

👉 Finds the highest and lowest salaries in the company.
📌 Example 3: Counting Employees Over 30 Years Old

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees WHERE age > 30;

👉 Counts how many employees are older than 30.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
✅ 3. HAVING Examples
📌 Example 1: Departments with More than 1 Employee

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

👉 Filters only departments that have more than one employee.
📌 Example 2: Departments with Total Salary Above 100000

SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;

👉 Displays only departments where the total salary exceeds 100,000.
📌 Example 3: Cities with an Average Salary Above 50000

SELECT city, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY city
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;

👉 Filters cities where the average salary is greater than 50,000.
🎯 Summary
Clause	Purpose	Example Use Case
GROUP BY	Groups data by a column	Count employees in each department
Aggregate Functions	Perform calculations on groups	Find total, average, min, max salary
HAVING	Filters groups after aggregation	Show departments with total salary > 100000
