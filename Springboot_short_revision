What is a Microservice? (Simple Explanation)

A Microservice is like a small, independent part of a bigger application. Instead of building one big system (monolithic architecture), we break it into small, separate services that can work on their own but communicate with each other.

Each microservice:
✅ Handles only one specific task (like handling users, orders, or payments).
✅ Runs independently and can be updated without affecting the whole system.
✅ Communicates with other microservices using APIs (like REST API).
Example: Online Shopping App

Imagine an e-commerce website like Amazon. Instead of one large system, we break it into microservices:

1️⃣ User Service – Manages user accounts, login, and profiles.
2️⃣ Product Service – Handles products, categories, and stock.
3️⃣ Order Service – Manages customer orders.
4️⃣ Payment Service – Handles payments and transactions.
5️⃣ Notification Service – Sends emails and SMS notifications.

Each service has its own database and runs independently. If the payment service fails, customers can still browse products because the product service works separately.
How Do They Communicate?

Microservices talk to each other using REST APIs, messaging queues (like RabbitMQ), or event-driven systems.

For example:

    When a user places an order, the Order Service calls the Payment Service to process payment.
    After payment, the Notification Service sends an email confirmation.

Benefits of Microservices:

✅ Scalability – If more users join, we can scale only the User Service instead of the whole system.
✅ Flexibility – Developers can work on different services independently.
✅ Easy Maintenance – Fixing or updating one service does not affect others.
✅ Faster Deployment – We can deploy changes faster without stopping the entire app.

What is JUnit Testing? (Simple Explanation)

JUnit is a testing framework used in Java to test if our code is working correctly. It helps us automate testing instead of manually checking outputs.

🔹 Why use JUnit?
✅ Finds bugs early in the development process.
✅ Automates testing → No need to run code manually.
✅ Ensures code quality and correctness.

Logging and Metrics (Simple Explanation)

Logging and metrics help developers monitor and debug applications.

🔹 Logging – Records what the application is doing (useful for debugging).
🔹 Metrics – Measures the performance of the application (useful for monitoring).

1️⃣ Spring Boot Actuator – Monitoring & Health Checks

🔹 What is it?
Spring Boot Actuator helps you monitor and manage your application by providing built-in endpoints like:
✅ Health Check (/actuator/health)
✅ Metrics (/actuator/metrics)
✅ Environment Info (/actuator/env)

🔹 Why use it?
✅ Check if the app is running properly.
✅ Get system performance insights.
✅ Debug issues without modifying code.
2️⃣ Spring Boot DevTools – Faster Development

🔹 What is it?
Spring Boot DevTools improves developer experience by:
✅ Auto Restart → Reloads the app on code changes.
✅ Live Reload → Refreshes browser automatically.
✅ Disables Cache → Helps see changes instantly.

🔹 Why use it?
✅ Saves time – No need to restart manually.
✅ Speeds up development.
