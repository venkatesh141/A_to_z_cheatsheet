Sure! Here's a simpler explanation of the key principles of microservices in Java:

1. Single Responsibility
Each microservice does one thing really well. For example, one microservice might handle user login, and another handles payment processing. 
This makes it easier to develop and maintain.

2. Loose Coupling
Microservices are independent from each other. They communicate through APIs (like web services) instead of sharing code directly.
 This way, one service can fail or change without breaking the entire system.

3. Independent Deployment
Microservices can be developed, updated, and deployed on their own. For example, 
if you want to change the payment service, you can update just that service without touching other services.

4. Own Data Storage
Each microservice should manage its own data, rather than sharing a single database.
 This way, each service has full control over its data, making the system more flexible and reliable.

5. API-First
Microservices communicate with each other through APIs (like RESTful web services). 
This makes it easy for services to talk to each other, even if they are written in different programming languages.

6. Fault Isolation
If one service breaks, it should not take down the whole system.
 Microservices are designed to handle errors and keep running as much as possible, even if one service fails.

7. Continuous Delivery
You can release updates to a microservice at any time without affecting the whole system. This means you can fix bugs, add features, and improve performance more frequently.

8. Scalability
You can scale a microservice up or down depending on how much work it needs to do.
 For example, if more people are using the payment service, you can add more resources just to that service, not the whole system.

9. Event-Driven Communication
Microservices can communicate by sending events or messages to each other. 
This helps them work asynchronously (not waiting for responses immediately), which can make the system more efficient.

10. Security
Each microservice should handle its own security. 
You can use tools to make sure services talk to each other securely, and users are properly authenticated and authorized to access the services.

11. Monitoring and Logging
It's important to keep track of what's happening in each microservice. 
With monitoring and logging tools, you can track performance, see if anything breaks, and fix issues quickly.
