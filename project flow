📌 What Should We Do Before Starting a Project?
Before starting a software project, proper planning and preparation are crucial for success. Here’s what you need to do:

✅ 1. Define Project Goals & Requirements
Identify the problem your project will solve.
Define features & functionalities required.
Gather requirements from clients/users.
Set clear objectives (e.g., performance, security, usability).
✅ 2. Choose Technology Stack
Backend: Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, Python, etc.
Frontend: React.js, Angular, Vue.js.
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD.
✅ 3. Plan System Architecture
Decide on Monolithic vs. Microservices architecture.
Identify APIs, Services, Database Design.
Plan security measures like JWT Authentication.
✅ 4. Design UI/UX
Create wireframes/mockups using Figma, Adobe XD.
Plan navigation & user experience.
✅ 5. Project Management Setup
Use tools like JIRA, Trello, Asana for tracking tasks.
Set sprint goals (Agile methodology).
Assign roles & responsibilities to team members.
📌 Project Flow (Step-by-Step Process)
🚀 Step 1: Planning & Analysis
Identify the problem statement.
Gather requirements from stakeholders.
Choose the tech stack.
Prepare high-level architecture.
💻 Step 2: Designing the System
UI/UX design (wireframes, mockups).
Database design (tables, relations).
API design (REST endpoints, request-response format).
Security considerations (authentication, authorization).
🛠️ Step 3: Development Phase
🔹 Backend Development (Spring Boot)
Setup Spring Boot Project

Create a Spring Boot application.
Configure dependencies (Spring Boot, JPA, Lombok, Security).
Create Model & Database

Define Entity classes.
Configure Spring Data JPA with MySQL.
Develop REST APIs

Create Controllers, Services, and Repositories.
Implement CRUD operations.
Implement Security

Use Spring Security + JWT Authentication.
Role-based access control.
🔹 Frontend Development (React/Angular)
Setup Frontend Framework (React/Angular).
Design UI Components (Navbar, Forms, Dashboards).
Consume REST APIs (Fetch data from backend).
State Management (Redux, Context API).
Form Validation & Error Handling.
🔄 Step 4: Integration & Testing
Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito).
API Testing (Postman, Swagger).
UI Testing (Selenium, Cypress).
Integration Testing (Verify frontend-backend connection).
🚢 Step 5: Deployment & Monitoring
Dockerize the application (Docker, Docker Compose).
Deploy to Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
Monitor with Spring Boot Actuator & Prometheus.
