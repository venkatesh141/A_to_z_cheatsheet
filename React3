Good question Venky 👌
Since you're learning React deeply, let’s understand this in a **very simple flow-based way**.

# 🔵 Topic: How NOT to Update the UI in React

(What happens behind the scenes)

---

# 🧠 First Understand One Rule

👉 In React:

> **UI updates only when state or props change**

If state doesn’t change → React does NOT re-render.

---

# ❌ WRONG WAY 1: Changing Normal Variable

### Example

```jsx
import React from "react";

function Counter() {
  let count = 0;   // ❌ normal variable

  function increase() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{count}</h2>
      <button onClick={increase}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### 🔎 What happens?

Step-by-step:

1️⃣ Component renders → count = 0
2️⃣ You click button → count becomes 1
3️⃣ But UI still shows 0

Why?

Because:

👉 React DOES NOT track normal variables
👉 React tracks only state

So UI does not update.

---

# ✅ CORRECT WAY: Using State

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function increase() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{count}</h2>
      <button onClick={increase}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### 🔎 Now What Happens?

1️⃣ Click button
2️⃣ setCount() is called
3️⃣ React marks component as “dirty”
4️⃣ React re-renders component
5️⃣ Virtual DOM compares old vs new
6️⃣ Only changed part updates

👉 UI updates correctly.

---

# ❌ WRONG WAY 2: Directly Modifying State

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

function increase() {
  count = count + 1;   // ❌ Wrong
}
```

This will NOT work.

Because:

👉 React re-renders only when `setCount()` is called
👉 Direct assignment does nothing

---

# ❌ WRONG WAY 3: Mutating Objects

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: "Venky" });

function changeName() {
  user.name = "Kumar";   // ❌ Mutating
  setUser(user);         // Same object reference
}
```

Why no UI update sometimes?

Because React checks:

👉 "Is this a new object or same object?"

If same reference → React may skip re-render.

---

# ✅ Correct Way (Immutable Update)

```jsx
function changeName() {
  setUser({ ...user, name: "Kumar" });
}
```

Now:

✔ New object created
✔ React sees new reference
✔ Re-render happens

---

# 🧠 Behind The Scenes (Very Simple)

When you call `setState()`:

1️⃣ React creates a new Virtual DOM
2️⃣ Compares with old Virtual DOM
3️⃣ Finds differences
4️⃣ Updates only changed elements in Real DOM

This process is called:

👉 **Reconciliation**

---

# 🔥 Big Picture (Important for Interviews)

React UI updates ONLY when:

* State changes
* Props change
* Parent re-renders

React UI does NOT update when:

* Normal variable changes
* You directly mutate state
* You don’t call setter function

---

# 🧑‍💻 Developer Takeaway (For You Venky)

Since you are practicing React deeply:

Always think:

> “Will this create a new state reference?”

If YES → UI updates
If NO → UI does not update

---

If you want, next I can explain:

👉 How React skips re-render using `React.memo`
👉 OR how React batching works behind the scenes

Tell me which one you want 🚀
