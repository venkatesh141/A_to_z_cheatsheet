Network
A network is a system that allows computers or devices to communicate with each other and share resources like data, files, and even internet connections. The devices in a network can be connected through wired connections (like cables) or wirelessly (using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.).

Example:
Imagine you have a printer at home, and you want to print something from your laptop or phone. If both your printer and devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, you can send a print job from your laptop/phone without physically plugging them into the printer. The Wi-Fi network is what allows the devices to communicate with the printer wirelessly.

Similarly, the internet is a global network that connects millions of computers, allowing them to exchange information. When you visit a website, your computer connects to a server over the internet to retrieve the web page.

Key Points:
Network: System of connected devices.
Devices: Computers, phones, printers, etc.
Purpose: Share resources (data, internet, files).
