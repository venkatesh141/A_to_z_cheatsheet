Network
A network is a system that allows computers or devices to communicate with each other
and share resources like data, files
, and even internet connections. The devices in a network can be connected through wired connections 
(like cables) or wirelessly (using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.).

Example:
Imagine you have a printer at home, and you want to print something from your laptop or phone.
If both your printer and devices are 
connected to the same Wi-Fi network, you can send a print job from your laptop/phone without physically plugging them into the printer. 
The Wi-Fi network is what allows the devices to communicate with the printer wirelessly.

Similarly, the internet is a global network that connects millions of computers,
allowing them to exchange information. When you visit a website, your computer connects to a server over the internet to retrieve the web page.

Key Points:
Network: System of connected devices.
Devices: Computers, phones, printers, etc.
Purpose: Share resources (data, internet, files).

Link

In simple terms, a link in computer networks is the connection between two devices
(like computers, routers, or phones) that allows them to communicate and share data.

Example:
Imagine you have two computers, A and B, and you want them to talk to each other or share files. 
To do this, you need to connect them with some kind of link. This link could be:

A physical wire, like an Ethernet cable, connecting both computers.
A wireless connection, like Wi-Fi, where both computers are connected to the same Wi-Fi router.
In both cases, the link is the path that data follows to travel between the two computers.
